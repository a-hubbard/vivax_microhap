  # As of version 8.2.0, it does not seem possible to configure 
  # Snakemake to work with the UNC Charlotte cluster. After following 
  # the necessary steps to switch from the deprecated --cluster 
  # argument to the new Slurm executor plugin, I received a 
  # WorkflowError that my username is not valid. After unsuccessful  
  # attempts to resolve this and find useful information online, I 
  # concluded that this issue must be caused by a bug with either 
  # Snakemake or the executor plugin. Hopefully this will be resolved 
  # in a future version, but for now the only solution I am aware of is 
  # to revert the version to before the switch to backend plugins that 
  # came with Snakemake 8.0.0.
