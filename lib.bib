  abstract = {Population displacement and other forced movement patterns following natural disasters, armed conflicts or due to socioeconomic reasons contribute to the global emergence of Aedes-borne viral disease epidemics. In particular, dengue epidemiology is critically affected by situations of displacement and forced movement patterns, particularly within and across borders. In this respect, waves of human movements have been a major driver for the changing epidemiology and outbreaks of the disease on local, regional and global scales. Both emerging dengue autochthonous transmission and outbreaks in countries known to be non-endemic and co-circulation and hyperendemicity with multiple dengue virus serotypes have led to the emergence of severe disease forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. This paper reviews the emergence of dengue outbreaks driven by population displacement and forced movements following natural disasters and conflicts within the context of regional and sub-regional groupings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum parasite populations in Ethiopia have been experiencing local selective pressures from drugs and immunity, leading to evolutionary adaptation. However, there was a paucity of data on genomic characterization and evolutionary adaptations of P. falciparum isolates from the central area of Ethiopia. METHODS: Whole-genome analysis of 25 P. falciparum isolates from central Ethiopia, specifically from West Arsi, were studied to determine their genetic diversity, population structures, and signatures of selection in known drug resistance alleles against global isolates from Cambodia, Thailand, DR Congo, and Malawi. RESULTS: A total of 18,517 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in Ethiopian P. falciparum isolates. About 84\% of the Ethiopian P. falciparum isolates had a FWS value\,{$>$}\,0.95 showing a dominant single genotype infection in most isolates at the time of collection with little potential for out-crossing as expected in areas with low transmission intensity. Within-host diversity of Ethiopian infections was significantly different from East African (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), but not Southeast Asian infections (P\,{$>$}\,0.05). A significant population structure has been observed by PCA and population differentiation between Ethiopian parasites and East African (Fst\,\textasciitilde\,10\%) and Southeast Asian populations (Fst\,\textasciitilde\,18\%), suggesting limited gene flow and the independent evolution of the Ethiopian parasite population. Moreover, a total of 125 genes under balancing selection was found that include ama1, trap, eba175, and lsa3, previously identified as targets of human host immunity. Recent directional selection analysis using integrated standardized haplotype score (IHS) did not detect any selection signatures in the Pfcrt, Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, Pfmdr1, and PfK13 genes. However, known drug resistance-conferring mutations analysis showed that at least one SNP marker was fixed in these genes, but not in Pfdhps and PfK13. CONCLUSION: Plasmodium falciparum populations in the central region of Ethiopia was structurally diverged from both Southeast Asian and other East African populations. Malaria infections in Ethiopia had low within-host diversity, and parasites carry fixed chloroquine resistance markers despite the withdrawal of this drug for the treatment of P. falciparum.},

This study utilized 12 polymorphic microsatellite (MS) markers and the Msp2 marker to examine diversity, multiplicity of infection (MOI) as well as the population structure of parasites circulating in two sites separated by about 92 km and with varying malaria transmission intensities within the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. METHODS: The diversity and MOI of P. falciparum parasites in 160 non-symptomatic volunteers living in Obom (high malaria transmission intensity) and Asutsuare (low malaria transmission intensity) aged between 8 and 60 years was determined using Msp2 genotyping and microsatellite analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum carriers as well as the parasite density of infections was significantly higher in Obom than in Asutsuare. Samples from Asutsuare and Obom were 100\% and 65\% clonal, respectively, by Msp2 genotyping but decreased to 50\% and 5\%, respectively, when determined by MS analysis. The genetic composition of parasites from Obom and Asutsuare were highly distinct, with parasites from Obom being more diverse than those from Asutsuare. CONCLUSION: Plasmodium falciparum parasites circulating in Obom are genetically more diverse and distinct from those circulating in Asutsuare. The MOI in samples from both Obom and Asutsuare increased when assessed by MS analysis relative to MSP2 genotyping. The TA40 and TA87 loci are useful markers for estimating MOI in high and low parasite prevalence settings.},

  abstract = {Arthropod disease vectors, most notably mosquitoes, ticks, tsetse flies, and sandflies, are strongly influenced by environmental conditions and responsible for the vast majority of global vector-borne human diseases. The most widely used statistical models to predict future vector distributions model species niches and project the models forward under future climate scenarios. Although these methods address variations in vector distributions through space, their capacity to predict changing distributions through time is far less certain. Here, we review modeling methods used to validate and forecast future distributions of arthropod vectors under the effects of climate change and outline the uses or limitations of these techniques. We then suggest a validation approach specific to temporal extrapolation models that is gaining momentum in macroecological modeling and has great potential for epidemiological modeling of disease vectors. We performed systematic searches in the Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar to identify peer-reviewed English journal articles that model arthropod disease vector distributions under future environment scenarios. We included studies published up to and including June, 2014. We identified 29 relevant articles for our review. The majority of these studies predicted current species niches and projected the models forward under future climate scenarios without temporal validation. Historically calibrated forecast models improve predictions of changing vector distributions by tracking known shifts through recently observed time periods. With accelerating climate change, accurate predictions of shifts in disease vectors are crucial to target vector control interventions where needs are greatest.},

Using scripting languages such as R to perform population genetic analyses can improve the reproducibility of research, but using R can be challenging for many researchers due to its steep learning curve. 2. PopGenReport is a new R package that simplifies performing population genetics analyses in R, through the use of a new report-generating function. The function popgenreport allows users to perform up to 13 pre-defined and 1 user-defined analyses through the use of a single command line. Each analysis generates figures and tables that are incorporated into a pdf report and are also made available as individual files (figures are provided in multiple formats, table contents are provided as csv files). 3. The package includes new R functions that simplify the importation of data from a spreadsheet file, examine allele distributions across populations and loci and identify private alleles, determine pairwise individual genetic distances using the methods of Smouse and Peakall () and Kosman and Leonard (), respectively, detect the presence of null alleles, calculate allelic richness, and test for spatial autocorrelation in genotypes using the methods of Smouse and Peakall (). 4. The package has a modular structure that makes the process of adding new functionality straightforward. To facilitate the addition of user-designed functions, the package includes a fully customizable module that can be automatically included in the pdf report. 5. To support users not experienced in R, the website (www.popgenreport.org) has a tutorial for the package and a downloadable, portable version of the package with LaTeX pre-configured for the Windows operating system.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Applied epidemiological models are used in predicting future trends of diseases, for the basic understanding of disease and health dynamics, and to improve the measurement of health indicators. Mapping the research outputs of epidemiological modelling studies concerned with transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and public health interventions in Africa will help to identify the areas with substantial levels of research activities, areas with gaps, and research output trends. METHODS: A scoping review of applied epidemiological models of infectious disease studies that involved first or last authors affiliated to African institutions was conducted. Eligible studies were those concerned with the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and public health interventions. The review was consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews. Four electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed publications up to the end of April 2020. RESULTS: Of the 5927 publications identified, 181 met the inclusion criteria. The review identified 143 publications with first authors having an African institutional affiliation (AIA), while 81 had both first and last authors with an AIA. The publication authors were found to be predominantly affiliated with institutions based in South Africa and Kenya. Furthermore, human immunodeficiency virus, malaria, tuberculosis, and Ebola virus disease were found to be the most researched infectious diseases. There has been a gradual increase in research productivity across Africa especially in the last ten years, with several collaborative efforts spread both within and beyond Africa. CONCLUSIONS: Research productivity in applied epidemiological modelling studies of infectious diseases may have increased, but there remains an under-representation of African researchers as leading authors. The study findings indicate a need for the development of research capacity through supporting existing institutions in Africa and promoting research funding that will address local health priorities.},

  abstract = {The area occupied by plastic-covered greenhouses has undergone rapid growth in recent years, currently exceeding 500,000 ha worldwide. Due to the vast amount of input (water, fertilisers, fuel, etc.) required, and output of different agricultural wastes (vegetable, plastic, chemical, etc.), the environmental impact of this type of production system can be serious if not accompanied by sound and sustainable territorial planning. For this, the new generation of satellites which provide very high resolution imagery, such as QuickBird and IKONOS can be useful. In this study, one QuickBird and one IKONOS satellite image have been used to cover the same area under similar circumstances. The aim of this work was an exhaustive comparison of QuickBird vs. IKONOS images in land-cover detection. In terms of plastic greenhouse mapping, comparative tests were designed and implemented, each with separate objectives. Firstly, the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) was applied using five different approaches combining R, G, B, NIR, and panchromatic bands. The combinations of the bands used, significantly influenced some of the indexes used to classify quality in this work. Furthermore, the quality classification of the QuickBird image was higher in all cases than that of the IKONOS image. Secondly, texture features derived from the panchromatic images at different window sizes and with different grey levels were added as a fifth band to the R, G, B, NIR images to carry out the MLC. The inclusion of texture information in the classification did not improve the classification quality. For classifications with texture information, the best accuracies were found in both images for mean and angular second moment texture parameters. The optimum window size in these texture parameters was 3×3 for IK images, while for QB images it depended on the quality index studied, but the optimum window size was around 15×15. With regard to the grey level, the optimum was 128. Thus, the optimum texture parameter depended on the main objective of the image classification. If the main classification goal is to minimize the number of pixels wrongly classified, the mean texture parameter should be used, whereas if the main classification goal is to minimize the unclassified pixels the angular second moment texture parameter should be used. On the whole, both QuickBird and IKONOS images offered promising results in classifying plastic greenhouses. © 2008 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).},

However, the economic and computational resources needed generate a tradeoff between the amount of loci that can be obtained and the number of populations or individuals that can be sequenced. In this work, we analyzed and compared two simulated genomic datasets fitting a hierarchical structure, two extensive empirical genomic datasets, and a dataset comprising microsatellite information. For all datasets, we generated different subsampling designs by changing the number of loci, individuals, populations, and individuals per population to test for deviations in classic population genetics parameters (H S , F IS , F ST ). For the empirical datasets we also analyzed the effect of sampling design on landscape genetic tests (isolation by distance and environment, central abundance hypothesis). We also tested the effect of sampling a different number of populations in the detection of outlier SNPs. We found that the microsatellite dataset is very sensitive to the number of individuals sampled when obtaining summary statistics. F IS was particularly sensitive to a low sampling of individuals in the simulated, genomic, and microsatellite datasets. For the empirical and simulated genomic datasets, we found that as long as many populations are sampled, few individuals and loci are needed. For the empirical datasets, we found that increasing the number of populations sampled was important in obtaining precise landscape genetic estimates. Finally, we corroborated that outlier tests are sensitive to the number of populations sampled. We conclude by proposing different sampling designs depending on the objectives.},

This study has investigated the multiplicity of infection (MOI) within asymptomatic residents of the Kintampo districts, and the influence of age and seasonality on MOI, by studying the distribution of the polymorphic Plasmodium falciparum antigen merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2). METHODS: DNA was extracted from an asymptomatic cohort of children and adults infected with P. falciparum during the period November 2003 to October 2004. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out and multiplicity of infection (MOI) was determined. RESULTS: Children under 10 years of age had an average MOI of 2.3 while adults 18 years and above had an average MOI of 1.4. Children below five years had high and low average MOIs of 2.8 in the March/April survey and 0.9 in the May/June survey respectively. A similar trend in the monthly distribution of MOI was observed for the entire cohort. IC/3D7 strains outnumbered the FC27 strains throughout the year by a ratio of about 4:1 with the difference between the prevalence of the two strains being least marked in the March/April survey, at the beginning of the rainy season. MOI was not linked to the level of malaria transmission as measured by the entomological inoculation rate. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The impact of interventions, introduced since this baseline study was carried out on the parasite diversity of asymptomatic residents will be the subject of further investigations.},

  abstract = {A new procedure is introduced to downscale low-spatial-resolution inundation extents from Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) to a 3-arc-s (90m) dataset (known as GIEMS-D3). The methodology is based on topography and hydrography information from the HydroSHEDS database. A new floodability index is introduced and an innovative smoothing procedure is developed to ensure a smooth transition, in the high-resolution maps, between the low-resolution boxes from GIEMS. Topography information is pertinent for natural hydrology environments controlled by elevation but ismore limited in humanmodified basins. However, the proposed downscaling approach is compatible with forthcoming fusion of other, more pertinent satellite information in these difficult regions. The resulting GIEMS-D3 database is the only high-spatial-resolution inundation database available globally at a monthly time scale over the 1993–2007 period. GIEMS-D3 is assessed by analyzing its spatial and temporal variability and evaluated by comparisons to other independent satellite observations from visible (Google Earth and Landsat), infrared (MODIS), and active microwave (synthetic aperture radar).},

  abstract = {Automatic mapping and monitoring of agricultural landscapes using remotely sensed imagery has been an important research problem. This paper describes our work on developing automatic methods for the detection of target landscape features in very high spatial resolution images. The target objects of interest consist of linear strips of woody vegetation that include hedgerows and riparian vegetation that are important elements of the landscape ecology and biodiversity. The proposed framework exploits the spectral, textural, and shape properties of objects using hierarchical feature extraction and decision-making steps. First, a multifeature and multiscale strategy is used to be able to cover different characteristics of these objects in a wide range of landscapes. Discriminant functions trained on combinations of spectral and textural features are used to select the pixels that may belong to candidate objects. Then, a shape analysis step employs morphological top-hat transforms to locate the woody vegetation areas that fall within the width limits of an acceptable object, and a skeletonization and iterative least-squares fitting procedure quantifies the linearity of the objects using the uniformity of the estimated radii along the skeleton points. Extensive experiments using QuickBird imagery from three European Union member states show that the proposed algorithms provide good localization of the target objects in a wide range of landscapes with very different characteristics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an increasing need for finer spatial resolution data on malaria risk to provide micro-stratification to guide sub-national strategic plans. Here, spatial-statistical techniques are used to exploit routine data to depict sub-national heterogeneities in test positivity rate (TPR) for malaria among patients attending health facilities in Kenya. METHODS: Routine data from health facilities (n\,=\,1804) representing all ages over 24~months (2018-2019) were assembled across 8 counties (62 sub-counties) in Western Kenya. Statistical model-based approaches were used to quantify heterogeneities in TPR and uncertainty at fine spatial resolution adjusting for missingness, population distribution, spatial data structure, month, and type of health facility. RESULTS: The overall monthly reporting rate was 78.7\% (IQR 75.0-100.0) and public-based health facilities were more likely than private facilities to report ≥\,12~months (OR 5.7, 95\% CI 4.3-7.5). There was marked heterogeneity in population-weighted TPR with sub-counties in the north of the lake-endemic region exhibiting the highest rates (exceedance probability {$>$}\,70\% with 90\% certainty) where approximately 2.7 million (28.5\%) people reside. At micro-level the lowest rates were in 14 sub-counties (exceedance probability {$<$}\,30\% with 90\% certainty) where approximately 2.2 million (23.1\%) people lived and indoor residual spraying had been conducted since 2017. CONCLUSION: The value of routine health data on TPR can be enhanced when adjusting for underlying population and spatial structures of the data, highlighting small-scale heterogeneities in malaria risk often masked in broad national stratifications. Future research should aim at relating these heterogeneities in TPR with traditional community-level prevalence to improve tailoring malaria control activities at sub-national levels.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) targeting histidine rich protein 2(HRP2) are widely used for diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infections. Besides PfHRP2, the PfHRP3 antigen contributes to the detection of P. falciparum infections in PfHRP2 RDTs. However, the performance HRP2-based RDT is affected by pfhrp2/3 gene deletions resulting in false-negative test results. The objective of this study was to determine the presence and prevalence of pfhrp2/3 gene deletions including the respective flanking regions among symptomatic patients in Assosa zone, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A health-facility based cross-sectional study was conducted in febrile patients seeking a malaria diagnosis in 2018. Blood samples were collected by finger-prick for microscopic examination of blood smears, malaria RDT, and molecular analysis using dried blood spots (DBS) prepared on Whatman filter paper. A total of 218 P. falciparum positive samples confirmed by quantitative PCR were included for molecular assay of pfhrp2/3 target gene. RESULTS: Of 218 P. falciparum positive samples, exon 2 deletions were observed in 17.9\% of pfhrp2 gene and in 9.2\% of pfhrp3 gene. A high proportion of deletions in short segments of pfhrp2 exon1-2 (50\%) was also detected while the deletions of the pfhrp3 exon1-2 gene were 4.1\%. The deletions were extended to the downstream and upstream of the flanking regions in pfhrp2/3 gene (above 30\%). Of eighty-six PfHRP2 RDT negative samples, thirty-six lacked pfhrp2 exon 2. Five PfHRP2 RDT negative samples had double deletions in pfhrp2 exon 2 and pfhrp3 exon2. Of these double deletions, only two of the samples with a parasite density above 2000 parasite/µl were positive by the microscopy. Three samples with intact pfhrp3 exon2 in the pfhrp2 exon2 deleted parasite isolates were found to be positive by PfHRP2 RDT and microscopy with a parasite density above 10,000/µl. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the presence of deletions of pfhrp2/3 gene including the flanking regions. Pfhrp2/3 gene deletions results in false-negative results undoubtedly affect the current malaria control and elimination effort in the country. However, further countrywide investigations are required to determine the magnitude of pfhrp2/3 gene deletions and its consequences on routine malaria diagnosis.},

However, little is known regarding the diagnostic performances of these RDTs in the Assosa zone of northwest Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic performances of PfHRP2 and PfLDH RDTs using microscopy and quantitative PCR (qPCR) as a reference test. A health facility-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from malaria-suspected study participants at selected health centers from November to December 2018. Finger-prick blood samples were collected for microscopy, RDTs, and qPCR method. The prevalence of P. falciparum was 26.4\%, 30.3\%, and 24.1\% as determined by microscopy, PfHRP2 RDT, and PfLDH RDT, respectively. Compared with microscopy, the sensitivity and specificity of the PfHRP2 RDT were 96\% and 93\%, respectively, and those of the PfLDH RDT were 89\% and 99\%, respectively. Compared with qPCR, the specificity of the PfHRP2 RDT (93\%) and PfLDH RDT (98\%) was high, but the sensitivity of the PfHRP2 RDT (77\%) and PfLDH RDT (70\%) was relatively low. These malaria RDTs and reference microscopy methods showed reasonable agreement with a kappa value above 0.85 and provided accurate diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria. Thus, the current malaria RDT in the Ministry of Health program can be used in the Assosa zone of Ethiopia. However, continuous monitoring of the performance of PfHRP2 RDT is important to support control and elimination of malaria in Ethiopia.},

However, false negative results of RDT caused by genetic variation of P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 and 3 genes (pfhrp2/3) threaten existing malaria case management and control efforts. The main objective of this study was to investigate the genetic variations of the pfhrp2/3 genes. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from malaria symptomatic individuals in 2018 in Assosa zone, Ethiopia. Finger-prick blood samples were collected for RDT and microscopic examination of thick and thin blood films. Dried blood spots (DBS) were used for genomic parasite DNA extraction and molecular detection. Amplification of parasite DNA was made by quantitative PCR. DNA amplicons of pfhrp2/3 were purified and sequenced. RESULTS: The PfHRP2 amino acid repeat type isolates were less conserved compared to the PfHRP3 repeat type. Eleven and eight previously characterized PfHRP2 and PfHRP3 amino acid repeat types were identified, respectively. Type 1, 4 and 7 repeats were shared by PfHRP2 and PfHRP3 proteins. Type 2 repeats were found only in PfHRP2, while types 16 and 17 were found only in PfHRP3 with a high frequency in all isolates. 18 novel repeat types were found in PfHRP2 and 13 novel repeat types were found in PfHRP3 in single or multiple copies per isolate. The positivity rate for PfHRP2 RDT was high, 82.9\% in PfHRP2 and 84.3\% in PfHRP3 sequence isolates at parasitaemia levels {$>$}\,250 parasites/µl. Using the Baker model, 100\% of the isolates in group A (If product of types 2\,×\,type 7 repeats ≥\,100) and 73.7\% of the isolates in group B (If product of types 2\,×\,type 7 repeats 50-99) were predicted to be detected by PfHRP2 RDT at parasitaemia level\,{$>$}\,250 parasite/μl. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate the presence of different PfHRP2 and PfHRP3 amino acid repeat including novel repeats in P. falciparum from Ethiopia. These results indicate that there is a need to closely monitor the performance of PfHRP2 RDT associated with the genetic variation of the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene in P. falciparum isolates at the country-wide level.},

This study investigated the geographical origin and genetic diversity of P. vivax in Sudan using 14 microsatellite markers. A total of 113 clinical P. vivax samples were collected from two different ecogeographical zones, New Halfa and Khartoum, in Sudan. Additionally, 841 geographical samples from the database were incorporated for a global genetic analysis to discern genetic relationships among P. vivax isolates on regional and worldwide scales. On the regional scale, our findings revealed 91 unique and 8 shared haplotypes among the Sudan samples, showcasing a remarkable genetic diversity compared to other geographical isolates and supporting the hypothesis that P. vivax originated from Africa. On a global scale, distinct genetic clustering of P. vivax isolates from Africa, South America, and Asia (including Papua New Guinea and Solomon Island) was observed, with limited admixture among the three clusters. Principal component analysis emphasized the substantial contribution of African isolates to the observed global genetic variation. The Sudanese populations displayed extensive genetic diversity, marked by significant multi-locus linkage disequilibrium, suggesting an ancestral source of P. vivax variation globally and frequent recombination among the isolates. Notably, the East African P. vivax exhibited similarity with some Asian isolates, indicating potential recent introductions. Overall, our results underscore the effectiveness of utilizing microsatellite markers for implementing robust control measures, given their ability to capture extensive genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium patterns.},

Various studies have clearly demonstrated the impact of climate change on human health in Pakistan. This has increased the rate of morbidity and mortality, related not only to vector-borne, water-borne and food-borne diseases but has also contributed to the prevalence of neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory disorders. It is therefore important to take adequate measurements for water management and improve sanitary conditions especially in case of natural disasters. In order to effectively control the emerging and re-emerging infections in the country, an early, more Rigorous response is required, by the national health department, to monitor and evaluate the spread of infections in future. Therefore, precise planning and management strategies should be defined in order to circumvent the damage caused by the natural disasters associated with climate changes. This mini-review gives an overview about the public health issues associated with environmental change with special reference to Pakistan. This will provide a baseline for policymakers to develop public health surveillance programs in Pakistan.},

  abstract = {1. The integration of population genetics with explicit spatial analyses is crucial to address a range of evolutionary and ecological questions under realistic scenarios. Ignoring space can lead to misleading inferences, yet incorporating spatial realism leads to using complex evolutionary models that necessitate distilling raw genetic data into summary statistics that capture information relevant to the models in question. However, summary statistics derived from traditional population genetic theory overlook the valuable spatial component of genetic variation that is innate in natural systems and can be informative about historical spatio-demographic processes. 2. To overcome this limitation, we introduce and evaluate a new set of spatially explicit summary statistics that can be calculated from a wide range of molecular markers and that take advantage of well-established spatial genetic algorithms to summarize the spatial distribution and autocorrelation of genetic variation. Using spatially explicit demographic simulations of SNP data, we characterize their behaviour under different realistic historical demographic scenarios and assess their relative contribution to accurate model selection and parameter estimation. 3. We demonstrate that under a wide range of parameter values, alternate demographic histories could be best differentiated by supplementing traditional summary statistics with these new spatial statistics. We identify different subset of statistics, including Euclidean distances in spatial-PCA space, Monmonier's identification of genetic breaks and spatial correlograms, that greatly improve discrimination of complex species histories and have sizeable potential to estimate associated parameters, although the added power is likely to be dependent on landscape models and sampling configurations. 4. These results highlight the potential benefits of condensing spatial genetic information into informative summary statistics to substantially improve testing alternative historical demographic models that reflect the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of species evolutionary histories. This study bridges phylogeography and landscape genetics by paving the way for phylogeographers wanting to incorporate spatial models and data as well as landscape geneticists wanting to incorporate history.},

  abstract = {Malaria has declined significantly in The Gambia and determining transmission dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum can help targeting control interventions towards elimination. This can be inferred from genetic similarity between parasite isolates from different sites and timepoints. Here, we imposed a P. falciparum life cycle time on a genetic distance likelihood model to determine transmission paths from a 54 SNP barcode of 355 isolates. Samples were collected monthly during the 2013 malaria season from six pairs of villages spanning 300\,km from western to eastern Gambia. There was spatial and temporal hierarchy in pairwise genetic relatedness, with the most similar barcodes from isolates within the same households and village. Constrained by travel data, the model detected 60 directional transmission events, with 27\% paths linking persons from different regions. We identified 13 infected individuals (4.2\% of those genotyped) responsible for 2 to 8 subsequent infections within their communities. These super-infectors were mostly from high transmission villages. When considering paths between isolates from the most distant regions (west vs east) and travel history, there were 3 transmission paths from eastern to western Gambia, all at the peak (October) of the malaria transmission season. No paths with known travel originated from the extreme west to east. Although more than half of all paths were within-village, parasite flow from east to west may contribute to maintain transmission in western Gambia, where malaria transmission is already low. Therefore, interrupting malaria transmission in western Gambia would require targeting eastern Gambia, where malaria prevalence is substantially higher, with intensified malaria interventions.},

  abstract = {Ebb and flow of parasite populations The population genetics of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum across Africa is poorly understood but important to know for grasping the risks and dynamics of the spread of drug resistance. Harnessing the power of genomics, Amambua-Ngwa et al. of the Plasmodium Diversity Network Africa found substantial population structure within Africa that is consistent with human and vector population divergence (see the Perspective by Sibley). Specific signatures of selection by antimalarial drugs were detected, along with indications of the effect of colonization and slavery. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing showed that there is extensive gene flow among the different regions and that Ethiopia has a distinctive population of P. falciparum, which may be indicative of coexistence with another malaria parasite, P. vivax. Science, this issue p. 813; see also p. 752 Understanding genomic variation and population structure of Plasmodium falciparum across Africa is necessary to sustain progress toward malaria elimination. Genome clustering of 2263 P. falciparum isolates from 24 malaria-endemic settings in 15 African countries identified major western, central, and eastern ancestries, plus a highly divergent Ethiopian population. Ancestry aligned to these regional blocs, overlapping with both the parasite’s origin and with historical human migration. The parasite populations are interbred and shared genomic haplotypes, especially across drug resistance loci, which showed the strongest recent identity-by-descent between populations. A recent signature of selection on chromosome 12 with candidate resistance loci against artemisinin derivatives was evident in Ghana and Malawi.

  abstract = {New Guinea is a topographically and biogeographically complex region that supports unique endemic fauna. Studies describing the population connectivity of species through this region are scarce. We present a population and landscape genetic study on the endemic malaria-transmitting mosquito, Anopheles koliensis (Owen). Using mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data, as well as microsatellites, we show the evidence of geographically discrete population structure within Papua New Guinea (PNG). We also confirm the existence of three rDNA ITS2 genotypes within this mosquito and assess reproductive isolation between individuals carrying different genotypes. Microsatellites reveal the clearest population structure and show four clear population units. Microsatellite markers also reveal probable reproductive isolation between sympatric populations in northern PNG with different ITS2 genotypes, suggesting that these populations may represent distinct cryptic species. Excluding individuals belonging to the newly identified putative cryptic species (ITS2 genotype 3), we modeled the genetic differences between A. koliensis populations through PNG as a function of terrain and find that dispersal is most likely along routes with low topographic relief. Overall, these results show that A. koliensis is made up of geographically and genetically discrete populations in Papua New Guinea with landscape topography being important in restricting dispersal.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extensive genetic diversity in the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) is a major contributing factor to the moderate efficacy of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine. The transmission intensity and rates of recombination within and between populations influence the extent of its genetic diversity. Understanding the extent and dynamics of PfCSP genetic diversity in different transmission settings will help to interpret the results of current RTS,S efficacy and Phase IV implementation trials conducted within and between populations in malaria-endemic areas such as Ghana. METHODS: Pfcsp sequences were retrieved from the Illumina-generated paired-end short-read sequences of 101 and 131 malaria samples from children aged 6-59~months presenting with clinical malaria at health facilities in Cape Coast (in the coastal belt) and Navrongo (Guinea savannah region), respectively, in Ghana. The sequences were mapped onto the 3D7 reference strain genome to yield high-quality genome-wide coding sequence data. Following data filtering and quality checks to remove missing data, 220 sequences were retained and analysed for the allele frequency spectrum, genetic diversity both within the host and between populations and signatures of selection. Population genetics tools were used to determine the extent and dynamics of Pfcsp diversity in P. falciparum from the two geographically distinct locations in Ghana. RESULTS: Pfcsp showed extensive diversity at the two sites, with the higher transmission site, Navrongo, exhibiting higher within-host and population-level diversity. The vaccine strain C-terminal epitope of Pfcsp was found in only 5.9\% and 45.7\% of the Navrongo and Cape Coast sequences, respectively. Between 1 and 6 amino acid variations were observed in the TH2R and TH3R epitope regions of PfCSP. Tajima's D was negatively skewed, especially for the population from Cape Coast, given the expected historical population expansion. In contrast, a positive Tajima's D was observed for the Navrongo P. falciparum population, consistent with balancing selection acting on the immuno-dominant TH2R and TH3R vaccine epitopes. CONCLUSION: The low frequencies of the Pfcsp vaccine haplotype in the analysed populations indicate a need for additional molecular and immuno-epidemiological studies with broader temporal and geographic sampling in endemic populations targeted for RTS,S application. These results have implications for the efficacy of the vaccine in Ghana and will inform the choice of alleles to be included in future multivalent or chimeric vaccines.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the relationship between Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission and health outcomes requires accurate estimates of exposure to infectious mosquitoes. However, measures of exposure such as mosquito density and entomological inoculation rate (EIR) are generally aggregated over large areas and time periods, biasing the outcome-exposure relationship. There are few studies examining the extent and drivers of local variation in malaria exposure in endemic areas. METHODS: We describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of malaria transmission intensity measured by mosquito density and EIR in the KEMRI/CDC health and demographic surveillance system using entomological data collected during 2002-2004. Geostatistical zero inflated binomial and negative binomial models were applied to obtain location specific (house) estimates of sporozoite rates and mosquito densities respectively. Model-based predictions were multiplied to estimate the spatial pattern of annual entomological inoculation rate, a measure of the number of infective bites a person receive per unit of time. The models included environmental and climatic predictors extracted from satellite data, harmonic seasonal trends and parameters describing space-time correlation. RESULTS: Anopheles gambiae s.l was the main vector species accounting for 86\% (n=2309) of the total mosquitoes collected with the remainder being Anopheles funestus. Sixty eight percent (757/1110) of the surveyed houses had no mosquitoes. Distance to water bodies, vegetation and day temperature were strongly associated with mosquito density. Overall annual point estimates of EIR were 6.7, 9.3 and 9.6 infectious bites per annum for 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively. Monthly mosquito density and EIR varied over the study period peaking in May during the wet season each year. The predicted and observed densities of mosquitoes and EIR showed a strong seasonal and spatial pattern over the study area. CONCLUSIONS: Spatio-temporal maps of malaria transmission intensity obtained in this study are not only useful in understanding variability in malaria epidemiology over small areas but also provide a high resolution exposure surface that can be used to analyse the impact of transmission on malaria related and all-cause morbidity and mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic diversity in Plasmodium falciparum populations can be used to describe the resilience and spatial distribution of the parasite in the midst of intensified intervention efforts. This study used microsatellite analysis to evaluate the genetic diversity and population dynamics of P. falciparum parasites circulating in three ecological zones of Ghana. METHODS: A total of 1168 afebrile children aged between 3 to 13\,years were recruited from five (5) Primary schools in 3 different ecological zones (Sahel (Tamale and Kumbungu), Forest (Konongo) and Coastal (Ada and Dodowa)) of Ghana. Asymptomatic malaria parasite carriage was determined using microscopy and PCR, whilst fragment analysis of 6 microsatellite loci was used to determine the diversity and population structure of P. falciparum parasites. RESULTS: Out of the 1168 samples examined, 16.1 and 39.5\% tested positive for P. falciparum by microscopy and nested PCR respectively. The genetic diversity of parasites in the 3 ecological zones was generally high, with an average heterozygosity (He) of 0.804, 0.787 and 0.608 the rainy (peak) season for the Sahel, Forest and Coastal zones respectively. The mean He for the dry (off-peak) season were 0.562, 0.693 and 0.610 for the Sahel, Forest and Coastal zones respectively. Parasites from the Forest zone were more closely related to those from the Sahel than from the Coastal zone, despite the Coastal zone being closer in physical distance to the Forest zone. The fixation indexes among study sites ranged from 0.049 to 0.112 during the rainy season and 0.112 to 0.348 during the dry season. CONCLUSION: A large asymptomatic parasite reservoir was found in the school children during both rainy and dry seasons, especially those in the Forest and Sahel savannah zones where parasites were also found to be related compared to those from the Coastal zone. Further studies are recommended to understand why despite the roll out of several malaria interventions in Ghana, high transmission still persist.},

Understanding the landscape features impacting the spread of resistance makers is necessary to design suitable resistance management strategies. Here, we examined the influence of the highest mountain in West Africa (Mount Cameroon; 4095 m elevation) on the spread of metabolic and target-site resistance alleles in An. funestus populations. Vector composition varied across the four localities surveyed along the altitudinal cline with major vectors exhibiting high parity rate (80.5\%). Plasmodium infection rates ranged from 0.79\% (An. melas) to 4.67\% (An. funestus). High frequencies of GSTe2R (67-81\%) and RdlR (49-90\%) resistance alleles were observed in An. funestus throughout the study area, with GSTe2R frequency increasing with altitude, whereas the opposite is observed for RdlR. Patterns of genetic diversity and population structure analyses revealed high levels of polymorphisms with 12 and 16 haplotypes respectively for GSTe2 and Rdl. However, the reduced diversity patterns of resistance allele carriers revealed signatures of positive selection on the two genes across the study area irrespective of the altitude. Despite slight variations associated with the altitude, the spread of resistance alleles suggest that control strategies could be implemented against malaria vectors across mountainous landscapes.},

  abstract = {Landscape features exist at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and these naturally affect spatial genetic structure and our ability to make inferences about gene flow. This article discusses how decisions about sampling of genotypes (including choices about analytical methods and genetic markers) should be driven by the scale of spatial genetic structure, the time frame that landscape features have existed in their current state, and all aspects of a species’ life history. Researchers should use caution when making inferences about gene flow, especially when the spatial extent of the study area is limited. The scale of sampling of the landscape introduces different features that may affect gene flow. Sampling grain should be smaller than the average home-range size or dispersal distance of the study organism and, for raster data, existing research suggests that simplifying the thematic resolution into discrete classes may result in low power to detect effects on gene flow. Therefore, the methods used to characterize the landscape between sampling sites may be a primary determinant for the spatial scale at which analytical results are applicable, and the use of only one sampling scale for a particular statistical method may lead researchers to overlook important factors affecting gene flow. The particular analytical technique used to correlate landscape data and genetic data may also influence results; common landscape-genetic methods may not be suitable for all study systems, particularly when the rate of landscape change is faster than can be resolved by common molecular markers.},

  abstract = {Multiple, selectively neutral genetic markers are the most appropriate tools for analysis of parasite population structure and epidemiology, but yet existing methods for characterization of malaria field samples utilize a limited number of antigen encoding genes, which appear to be under strong selection. We describe protocols for characterization of 12 microsatellite markers from finger-prick blood samples infected with Plasmodium falciparum. A two-step, heminested strategy was used  to amplify all loci, and products were visualized by fluorescent end-labelling of internal primers. This procedure allows  amplification from low levels of template, while eliminating the problem of spurious products due to primer carry over from the primary round of PCR. The loci can be conveniently multiplexed, while accurate sizing and quantification of PCR products can be automated using the GENOTYPER software. The primers do not amplify co-infecting malaria species such as P. vivax and P. malariae. To demonstrate the utility of these markers, we characterized 57 infected finger-prick blood samples from the village of Mebat in Papua New Guinea for all 12 loci, and all samples were genotyped a second time to measure reproducibility. Numbers of alleles per locus range from 4 to 10 in this population, while heterozygosities  range from 0·21 to 0·87. Reproducibility (measured as concordance between predominant alleles detected in replicate  samples) ranged from 92 to 98\% for the 12 loci. The composition of PCR products from infections containing multiple  malaria clones could also be defined using strict criteria and scored in a highly repeatable manner.},

The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify “outliers,” as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract = {Vivax malaria was historically described as 'benign tertian malaria' because individual clinical episodes were less likely to cause severe illness than Plasmodium falciparum. Despite this, Plasmodium vivax was, and remains, responsible for major morbidity and significant mortality in vivax-endemic areas. Single infections causing febrile illness in otherwise healthy individuals rarely progress to severe disease. Nevertheless, in the presence of co-morbidities, P. vivax can cause severe illness and fatal outcomes. Recurrent or chronic infections in endemic areas can cause severe anaemia and malnutrition, particularly in early childhood. Other severe manifestations include acute lung injury, acute kidney injury and uncommonly, coma. Multiorgan failure and shock are described but further studies are needed to investigate the role of bacterial and other co-infections in these syndromes. In pregnancy, P. vivax infection can cause maternal anaemia, miscarriage, low birth weight and congenital malaria. Compared to P. falciparum, P. vivax has a greater capacity to elicit an inflammatory response, resulting in a lower pyrogenic threshold. Conversely, cytoadherence of P. vivax to endothelial cells is less frequent and parasite sequestration is not thought to be a significant cause of severe illness in vivax malaria. With a predilection for young red cells, P. vivax does not result in the high parasite biomass associated with severe disease in P. falciparum, but a four to fivefold greater removal of uninfected red cells from the circulation relative to P. falciparum is associated with a similar risk of severe anaemia. Mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of severe vivax syndromes remain incompletely understood.},

OgaraK is also able to model the life cycle of the parasite which includes both haploid and diploid phases and sexual and asexual reproduction. We also allow for the simulation of different inbreeding levels, an important difference between high and low transmission areas and a fundamental factor influencing the outcome of strategies to control or eliminate malaria.

  abstract = {A primary use of malaria parasite genomics is identifying highly related infections to quantify epidemiological, spatial, or temporal factors associated with patterns of transmission. For example, spatial clustering of highly related parasites can indicate foci of transmission and temporal differences in relatedness can serve as evidence for changes in transmission over time. However, for infections in settings of moderate to high endemicity, understanding patterns of relatedness is compromised by complex infections, overall high forces of infection, and a highly diverse parasite population. It is not clear how much these factors limit the utility of using genomic data to better understand transmission in these settings. In particular, further investigation is required to determine which patterns of relatedness we expect to see with high quality, densely sampled genomic data in a high transmission setting and how these observations change under different study designs, missingness, and biases in sample collection. Here we investigate two identity-by-state measures of relatedness and apply them to amplicon deep sequencing data collected as part of a longitudinal cohort in Western Kenya that has previously been analysed to identify individual-factors associated with sharing parasites with infected mosquitoes. With these data we use permutation tests, to evaluate several hypotheses about spatiotemporal patterns of relatedness compared to a null distribution. We observe evidence of temporal structure, but not of fine-scale spatial structure in the cohort data. To explore factors associated with the lack of spatial structure in these data, we construct a series of simplified simulation scenarios using an agent based model calibrated to entomological, epidemiological and genomic data from this cohort study to investigate whether the lack of spatial structure observed in the cohort could be due to inherent power limitations of this analytical method. We further investigate how our hypothesis testing behaves under different sampling schemes, levels of completely random and systematic missingness, and different transmission intensities.},

  abstract = {Targeted amplicon sequencing is a powerful and efficient tool to interrogate the P. falciparum genome and generate actionable data from infections to complement traditional malaria epidemiology. For maximum impact, genomic tools should be multi-purpose, robust, sensitive and reproducible. We developed, characterized, and implemented MAD4HatTeR, an amplicon sequencing panel based on Multiplex Amplicons for Drug, Diagnostic, Diversity, and Differentiation Haplotypes using Targeted Resequencing, along with a bioinformatic pipeline for data analysis. MAD4HatTeR targets 165 highly diverse loci, focusing on multiallelic microhaplotypes; key markers for drug and diagnostic resistance, including duplications and deletions; and csp and potential vaccine targets. In addition, it can detect non-falciparum Plasmodium species. We used laboratory control and field sample data to demonstrate the high sensitivity and robustness of the panel. The successful implementation of this method in five laboratories, including three in malaria-endemic African countries, showcases its feasibility in generating reproducible data across laboratories. Finally, we introduce an analytical approach to detect gene duplications and deletions from amplicon sequencing data. MAD4HatTeR is thus a powerful research tool and a robust resource for malaria public health surveillance and control.},

  abstract = {Here, we report the first population genetic study to examine the impact of indoor residual spraying (IRS) on Plasmodium falciparum in humans. This study was conducted in an area of high seasonal malaria transmission in Bongo District, Ghana. IRS was implemented during the dry season (November-May) in three consecutive years between 2013 and 2015 to reduce transmission and attempt to bottleneck the parasite population in humans towards lower diversity with greater linkage disequilibrium. The study was done against a background of widespread use of long-lasting insecticidal nets, typical for contemporary malaria control in West Africa. Microsatellite genotyping with 10~loci was used to construct 392 P.~falciparum multilocus infection haplotypes collected from two age-stratified cross-sectional surveys at the end of the wet seasons pre- and post-IRS. Three-rounds of IRS, under operational conditions, led to a {$>$}90\% reduction in transmission intensity and a 35.7\% reduction in the P.~falciparum prevalence (p~{$<~$}.001). Despite these declines, population genetic analysis of the infection haplotypes revealed no dramatic changes with only a slight, but significant increase in genetic diversity (He : pre-IRS~=~0.79 vs. post-IRS = 0.81, p~=~.048). Reduced relatedness of the parasite population (p~{$<~$}.001) was observed post-IRS, probably due to decreased opportunities for outcrossing. Spatiotemporal genetic differentiation between the pre- and post-IRS surveys (D~=~0.0329 [95\% CI: 0.0209 - 0.0473], p~=~.034) was identified. These data provide a genetic explanation for the resilience of P.~falciparum to short-term IRS programmes in high-transmission settings in sub-Saharan Africa.},

Whilst used successfully in low-transmission areas where infections are monoclonal and highly related, we present the first study to evaluate the performance of these 24- and 96-SNP molecular barcodes in African countries, characterised by moderate-to-high transmission, where multiclonal infections are prevalent. For SNP barcodes it is generally recommended that the SNPs chosen i) are biallelic, ii) have a minor allele frequency greater than 0.10, and iii) are independently segregating, to minimise bias in the analysis of genetic diversity and population structure. Further, to be standardised and used in many population genetic studies, these barcodes should maintain characteristics i) to iii) across various iv) geographies and v) time points. Using haplotypes generated from the MalariaGEN P. falciparum Community Project version six database, we investigated the ability of these two barcodes to fulfil these criteria in moderate-to-high transmission African populations in 25 sites across 10 countries. Predominantly clinical infections were analysed, with 52.3\% found to be multiclonal, generating high proportions of mixed-allele calls (MACs) per isolate thereby impeding haplotype construction. Of the 24- and 96-SNPs, loci were removed if they were not biallelic and had low minor allele frequencies in all study populations, resulting in 20- and 75-SNP barcodes respectively for downstream population genetics analysis. Both SNP barcodes had low expected heterozygosity estimates in these African settings and consequently biased analyses of similarity. Both minor and major allele frequencies were temporally unstable. These SNP barcodes were also shown to identify weak genetic differentiation across large geographic distances based on Mantel Test and DAPC. These results demonstrate that these SNP barcodes are vulnerable to ascertainment bias and as such cannot be used as a standardised approach for malaria surveillance in moderate-to-high transmission areas in Africa, where the greatest genomic diversity of P. falciparum exists at local, regional and country levels.},

It persists in nature through transmission between its hosts (wild rodents) and vectors (fleas). During epizootics, the disease expands and spills over to other host species such as humans living in or close to affected areas. Here, we investigate the effect of large-scale climate variability on the dynamics of human plague in the western United States using a 56-year time series of plague reports (1950-2005). We found that El Niño Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation in combination affect the dynamics of human plague over the western United States. The underlying mechanism could involve changes in precipitation and temperatures that impact both hosts and vectors. It is suggested that snow also may play a key role, possibly through its effects on summer soil moisture, which is known to be instrumental for flea survival and development and sustained growth of vegetation for rodents.},

  abstract = {By 2025, it is estimated that around 5 billion people, out of a total population of around 8 billion, will be living in countries experiencing water stress (using more than 20\% of their available resources). Climate change has the potential to impose additional pressures in some regions. This paper describes an assessment of the implications of climate change for global hydrological regimes and water resources. It uses climate change scenarios developed from Hadley Centre climate simulations (HadCM2 and HadCM3), and simulates global river flows at a spatial resolution of 0.5×0.5° using a macro-scale hydrological model. Changes in national water resources are calculated, including both internally generated runoff and upstream imports, and compared with national water use estimates developed for the United Nations Comprehensive Assessment of the Freshwater Resources of the World. Although there is variation between scenarios, the results suggest that average annual runoff will increase in high latitudes, in equatorial Africa and Asia, and southeast Asia, and will decrease in mid-latitudes and most subtropical regions. The HadCM3 scenario produces changes in runoff which are often similar to those from the HadCM2 scenarios — but there are important regional differences. The rise in temperature associated with climate change leads to a general reduction in the proportion of precipitation falling as snow, and a consequent reduction in many areas in the duration of snow cover. This has implications for the timing of streamflow in such regions, with a shift from spring snow melt to winter runoff. Under the HadCM2 ensemble mean scenario, the number of people living in countries with water stress would increase by 53 million by 2025 (relative to those who would be affected in the absence of climate change). Under the HadCM3 scenario, the number of people living in countries with water stress would rise by 113 million. However, by 2050 there would be a net reduction in populations in stressed countries under HadCM2 (of around 69 million), but an increase of 56 million under HadCM3. The study also showed that different indications of the impact of climate change on water resource stresses could be obtained using different projections of future water use. The paper emphasises the large range between estimates of “impact”, and also discusses the problems associated with the scale of analysis and the definition of indices of water resource impact.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, infection with Plasmodium vivax was thought to be benign and self-limiting, however, recent evidence has demonstrated that infection with P. vivax can also result in severe illness and death. Research into P. vivax has been relatively neglected and much remains unknown regarding the biology, pathogenesis and epidemiology of this parasite. One of the fundamental factors governing transmission and immunity is parasite diversity. An understanding of parasite population genetic structure is necessary to understand the epidemiology, diversity, distribution and dynamics of natural P. vivax populations. In addition, studying the population structure of genes under immune selection also enables investigation of the dynamic interplay between transmission and immunity, which is crucial for vaccine development. A lack of knowledge regarding the transmission and spread of P. vivax has been particularly highlighted in areas where malaria control and elimination programmes have made progress in reducing the burden of Plasmodium falciparum, yet P. vivax remains as a substantial obstacle. With malaria elimination back on the global agenda, mapping of global and local P. vivax population structure is essential prior to establishing goals for elimination and the roll-out of interventions. A detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution, transmission and clinical burden of P. vivax is required to act as a benchmark against which control targets can be set and measured. This paper presents an overview of what is known and what is yet to be fully understood regarding P. vivax population genetics, as well as the importance and application of P. vivax population genetics studies.},

  abstract = {Following unsuccessful eradication attempts there was a resurgence of malaria towards the end of the 20th century. Renewed control efforts using a range of improved tools, such as long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets and artemisinin-based combination therapies, have more than halved the global burden of disease, but it remains high with 445\hphantom{,}000 deaths and more than 200 million cases in 2016. Pitfalls in individual patient management are delayed diagnosis and overzealous fluid resuscitation in severe malaria. Even in the absence of drug resistance, parasite recurrence can occur, owing to high parasite densities, low host immunity, or suboptimal drug concentrations. Malaria elimination is firmly back as a mainstream policy but resistance to the artemisinin derivatives, their partner drugs, and insecticides present major challenges. Vaccine development continues on several fronts but none of the candidates developed to date have been shown to provide long-lasting benefits at a population level. Increased resources and unprecedented levels of regional cooperation and societal commitment will be needed if further substantial inroads into the malaria burden are to be made.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) are known to be highly effective in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. However, usage varies among households, and such variations in actual usage may seriously limit the potential impact of nets and cause spatial heterogeneity on malaria transmission. This study examined ITN ownership and underlying factors for among-household variation in use, and malaria transmission in two highland regions of western Kenya. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted on ITN ownership (possession), compliance (actual usage among those who own ITNs), and malaria infections in occupants of randomly sampled houses in the dry and the rainy seasons of 2009. RESULTS: Despite ITN ownership reaching more than 71\%, compliance was low at 56.3\%. The compliance rate was significantly higher during the rainy season compared with the dry season (62\% vs. 49.6\%). Both malaria parasite prevalence (11.8\% vs. 5.1\%) and vector densities (1.0 vs.0.4 female/house/night) were significantly higher during the rainy season than during the dry season. Other important factors affecting the use of ITNs include: a household education level of at least primary school level, significantly high numbers of nuisance mosquitoes, and low indoor temperatures. Malaria prevalence in the rainy season was about 30\% lower in ITN users than in non-ITN users, but this percentage was not significantly different during the dry season. CONCLUSION: In malaria hypo-mesoendemic highland regions of western Kenya, the gap between ITNownership and usage is generally high with greater usage recorded during the high transmission season. Because of the low compliance among those who own ITNs, there is a need to sensitize households on sustained use of ITNs in order to optimize their role as a malaria control tool.},

Overall infection complexity and genetic diversity was significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) lower in NHD than LHD, (Mean MOI = 2.45 vs. 2.97; Fws = 0.42 vs. 0.47; Mean He = 0.84 vs. 0.89, respectively). Multi-locus linkage disequilibrium was generally low but significantly higher in the NHD than LHD population (mean ISA= 0.376 vs 0.093). Consequently, highly related pairs of isolates were observed in NHD (mean IBS = 0.086) compared to those from the LHD (mean IBS = 0.059). Infections from the two regions were mostly unrelated (mean IBS = 0.059), though the overall genetic differentiation across the geographical range was low. Indices of differentiation between the populations were however significant (overall pairwise Fst = 0.048, Jost's D = 0.133, p {$<$} 0.01). Despite the high human migration across the 270km separating the study sites, these results suggest significant restrictions to gene flow against contiguous geospatial transmission of malaria in west Cameroon. Clonal infections in the highland sites could be driven by lower levels of malaria prevalence and seasonal transmission. How these differences in genetic diversity and complexity affect responses to interventions such as drugs will require further investigations from broader community sampling.},

Traditionally within-host diversity has been defined in terms of the multiplicity of infection (MOI) derived by PCR-based genotyping. Massively parallel, single molecule sequencing technologies now enable individual read counts to be derived on genome-wide datasets facilitating the development of new statistical approaches to describe within-host diversity. In this class of measures the F(WS) metric characterizes within-host diversity and its relationship to population level diversity. Utilizing P. falciparum field isolates from patients in West Africa we here explore the relationship between the traditional MOI and F(WS) approaches. F(WS) statistics were derived from read count data at 86,158 SNPs in 64 samples sequenced on the Illumina GA platform. MOI estimates were derived by PCR at the msp-1 and -2 loci. Significant correlations were observed between the two measures, particularly with the msp-1 locus (P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}5.92×10(-5)). The F(WS) metric should be more robust than the PCR-based approach owing to reduced sensitivity to potential locus-specific artifacts. Furthermore the F(WS) metric captures information on a range of parameters which influence out-crossing risk including the number of clones (MOI), their relative proportions and genetic divergence. This approach should provide novel insights into the factors which correlate with, and shape within-host diversity.},

  abstract = {Molecular approaches have an increasingly recognized utility in surveillance of malaria parasite populations, not only in defining prevalence and incidence with higher sensitivity than traditional methods, but also in monitoring local and regional parasite transmission patterns. In this review, we provide an overview of population genetic and genomic studies of human-infecting Plasmodium species, highlighting recent advances in the field. In accordance with the renewed impetus for malaria eradication, many studies are now using genetic and genomic epidemiology to support local evidence-based intervention strategies. Microsatellite genotyping remains a popular approach for both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. However, with the increasing availability of whole genome sequencing data enabling effective single nucleotide polymorphism-based panels tailored to a given study question and setting, this approach is gaining popularity. The availability of new reference genomes for Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale should see a surge in similar molecular studies on these currently neglected species. Genomic studies are revealing new insights into important adaptive mechanisms of the parasite including antimalarial drug resistance. The advent of new methodologies such as selective whole genome amplification for dealing with extensive human DNA in low density field isolates should see genome-wide approaches becoming routine for parasite surveillance once the economic costs outweigh the current cost benefits of targeted approaches.},

  abstract = {Highly parallel sequencing technologies permit cost-effective whole genome sequencing of hundreds of Plasmodium parasites. The ability to sequence clinical Plasmodium samples, extracted directly from patient blood without a culture step, presents a unique opportunity to sample the diversity of “natural” parasite populations in high resolution clinical and epidemiological studies. A major challenge to sequencing clinical Plasmodium samples is the abundance of human DNA, which may substantially reduce the yield of Plasmodium sequence. We tested a range of human white blood cell (WBC) depletion methods on P. falciparum-infected patient samples in search of a method displaying an optimal balance of WBC-removal efficacy, cost, simplicity, and applicability to low resource settings. In the first of a two-part study, combinations of three different WBC depletion methods were tested on 43 patient blood samples in Mali. A two-step combination of Lymphoprep plus Plasmodipur best fitted our requirements, although moderate variability was observed in human DNA quantity. This approach was further assessed in a larger sample of 76 patients from Burkina Faso. WBC-removal efficacy remained high ({$<$}30\% human DNA in {$>$}70\% samples) and lower variation was observed in human DNA quantities. In order to assess the Plasmodium sequence yield at different human DNA proportions, 59 samples with up to 60\% human DNA contamination were sequenced on the Illumina Genome Analyzer platform. An average ∼40-fold coverage of the genome was observed per lane for samples with ≤30\% human DNA. Even in low resource settings, using a simple two-step combination of Lymphoprep plus Plasmodipur, over 70\% of clinical sample preparations should exhibit sufficiently low human DNA quantities to enable ∼40-fold sequence coverage of the P. falciparum genome using a single lane on the Illumina Genome Analyzer platform. This approach should greatly facilitate large-scale clinical and epidemiologic studies of P. falciparum.},

We undertook the first population genomic investigation of P. vivax from the region, comparing the genomes of 24 Ethiopian isolates against data from Southeast Asia to identify important local adaptions. The prevalence of the Duffy binding protein amplification in Ethiopia was 79\%, potentially reflecting adaptation to Duffy negativity. There was also evidence of selection in a region upstream of the chloroquine resistance transporter, a putative chloroquine-resistance determinant. Strong signals of selection were observed in genes involved in immune evasion and regulation of gene expression, highlighting the need for a multifaceted intervention approach to combat P. vivax in the region.},

Laboratory studies of this species are constrained by the inability to maintain the parasite in continuous ex vivo culture, but genomic approaches provide an alternative and complementary avenue to investigate the parasite's biology and epidemiology. To date, molecular studies of P. vivax have relied on the Salvador-I reference genome sequence, derived from a monkey-adapted strain from South America. However, the Salvador-I reference remains highly fragmented with over 2500 unassembled scaffolds.~ Using high-depth Illumina sequence data, we assembled and annotated a new reference sequence, PvP01, sourced directly from a patient from Papua Indonesia. Draft assemblies of isolates from China (PvC01) and Thailand (PvT01) were also prepared for comparative purposes. The quality of the PvP01 assembly is improved greatly over Salvador-I, with fragmentation reduced to 226 scaffolds. Detailed manual curation has ensured highly comprehensive annotation, with functions attributed to 58\% core genes in PvP01 versus 38\% in Salvador-I. The assemblies of PvP01, PvC01 and PvT01 are larger than that of Salvador-I (28-30 versus 27 Mb), owing to improved assembly of the subtelomeres.~ An extensive repertoire of over 1200 Plasmodium interspersed repeat (pir) genes were identified in PvP01 compared to 346 in Salvador-I, suggesting a vital role in parasite survival or development. The manually curated PvP01 reference and PvC01 and PvT01 draft assemblies are important new resources to study vivax malaria. PvP01 is maintained at GeneDB and ongoing curation will ensure continual improvements in assembly and annotation quality.},

Microsatellite-based analysis of population structure suggests that parasites within the DRC form a homogeneous population. In contrast, sulfadoxine-resistance markers in dihydropteroate synthase show marked spatial structure with ongoing spread of double and triple mutants compared with 2007. These findings suggest that parasites in the DRC remain panmictic despite rapidly spreading antimalarial-resistance mutations. Moreover, highly multiplexed targeted sequencing using MIPs emerges as a cost-effective method for elucidating pathogen genetics in complex infections in large cohorts.},

We show here how the common practice of calling genotypes from a single SNP per sequenced region ignores substantial additional information in the phased short-read sequences that are provided by these sequencing instruments. We target sequenced regions with multiple SNPs in kelp rockfish (Sebastes atrovirens) to determine "microhaplotypes" and then call these microhaplotypes as alleles at each locus. We then demonstrate how these multi-allelic marker data from such loci dramatically increase power for relationship inference. The microhaplotype approach decreases false-positive rates by several orders of magnitude, relative to calling bi-allelic SNPs, for two challenging analytical procedures, full-sibling and single parent-offspring pair identification. We also show how the identification of half-sibling pairs requires so much data that physical linkage becomes a consideration, and that most published studies that attempt to do so are dramatically underpowered. The advent of phased short-read DNA sequence data, in conjunction with emerging analytical tools for their analysis, promises to improve efficiency by reducing the number of loci necessary for a particular level of statistical confidence, thereby lowering the cost of data collection and reducing the degree of physical linkage amongst markers used for relationship estimation. Such advances will facilitate collaborative research and management for migratory and other widespread species.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The East African highlands are fringe regions between stable and unstable malaria transmission. What factors contribute to the heterogeneity of malaria exposure on different spatial scales within larger foci has not been extensively studied. In a comprehensive, community-based cross-sectional survey an attempt was made to identify factors that drive the macro- and micro epidemiology of malaria in a fringe region using parasitological and serological outcomes. METHODS: A large cross-sectional survey including 17,503 individuals was conducted across all age groups in a 100~km(2) area in the Western Kenyan highlands of Rachuonyo South district. Households were geo-located and prevalence of malaria parasites and malaria-specific antibodies were determined by PCR and ELISA. Household and individual risk-factors were recorded. Geographical characteristics of the study area were digitally derived using high-resolution satellite images. RESULTS: Malaria antibody prevalence strongly related to altitude (1350-1600~m, p~{$<~$}0.001). A strong negative association with increasing altitude and PCR parasite prevalence was found. Parasite carriage was detected at all altitudes and in all age groups; 93.2~\% (2481/2663) of malaria infections were apparently asymptomatic. Malaria parasite prevalence was associated with age, bed net use, house construction features, altitude and topographical wetness index. Antibody prevalence was associated with all these factors and distance to the nearest water body. CONCLUSION: Altitude was a major driver of malaria transmission in this study area, even across narrow altitude bands. The large proportion of asymptomatic parasite carriers at all altitudes and the age-dependent acquisition of malaria antibodies indicate stable malaria transmission; the strong correlation between current parasite carriage and serological markers of malaria exposure indicate temporal stability of spatially heterogeneous transmission.},

  abstract = {Previous work demonstrated that when tobacco cell suspensions were inoculated with certain bacterial strains, the redox potential of the suspensions would increase (oxidative), as much as 100mV, and in some cases last more than an hour. To discover possible contributors to this prolonged redox potential burst, we examined the oxidation of various plant phenolics that were similar to those found in the cell suspensions. Acetosyringone, one of the major extracellular phenolics in tobacco cell suspensions, was unique in causing a prolonged increase in redox potential of more than 100mV when incubated with H2O2and peroxidase. The increase in potential appears to be due to a relatively stable radical intermediate. The length of time that the redox potential increased was dependent on the ratio of H2O2and acetosyringone. The most favorable was a 1:1 ratio. Invitro characterization showed that production of this intermediate is favored by relatively low pH (around 6) and cooler temperatures possibly due to slower kinetics. Phosphate buffer was substituted for MES buffer, which had been used initially but was found to interfere with the oxidation. The results of this study demonstrate that apoplastic phenolics, in addition to often playing a role as antioxidants that reduce H2O2, can also cause rapid transient periods of extreme redox potential creating a local environment hostile to pathogen ingress. © 2014.},

Past studies have shown that levels of extracellular phenolics are elicited in plant cell suspensions in response to bacteria, and that tomato plants infected with viroids showed changes in apoplastic phenolics. The method described here monitored changes in apoplastic phenolics in tobacco leaves following bacterial inoculation of the same tissue. Inoculation with a saprophyte, Pseudomonas fluorescens, which does not cause visible symptoms or physical damage, was used to elicit phenolics and examine the effects of variable parameters on phenolic composition. Location of the inoculation on the leaf, position, or developmental age of the leaf on the plant, and inoculum concentration were standardized for further experiments. The patterns of phenolic change in the apoplast were compared for tobacco inoculated with P. syringae pathovars, pv. syringae, which causes a resistant HR reaction within 15 h, and pv. tabaci, which causes a susceptible reaction with delayed visible symptoms. Both pathogens elicited lower increased levels of acetosyringone compared to the saprophyte, P. fluorescens but had greatly increased levels of the chlorogenic acid derivatives. The latter metabolites appear to have come from the intracellular stores, which could indicate a weakening of the apoplast/symplast barrier. This unexpected aspect will require further study of intracellular phenolics.},

This has led to an awareness of the importance of 'redox status' as a prime regulatory determinant of cellular function and responses to internal and external stimuli. It has been difficult to study the effect of or fluctuation in the redox potential during interactions, since the frequency of sampling is limiting. We tested a method of using redox electrodes with bacterial and plant cell suspensions to monitor the extracellular redox potential during different plant/bacterial interactions. The advantage of the electrodes is that they provide continuous and nonintrusive monitoring of the redox potential, and interact with a larger array of metabolites. We found four different responses of redox potential to different plant/bacterial interactions. The redox responses are coincident with phenolic changes in the extracellular fluid of the suspensions. Further investigation of the mechanisms and parameters that affect the technique will provide insight into using electrodes to measure redox potential in planta. © 2013.},

We needed a simpler technique that would allow us to compare the effects of various bacterial treatments on leaf tissue CGA levels over time. Here we describe such a technique that was rapid, used less tissue, and was highly reproducible. The final technique involved grinding a small amounts of leaf tissue in acidified water, which helped stabilize the phenolics, and after clarification by centrifugation could directly be analyzed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Ultraviolet and Mass spectrophotometer detectors (UHPLC-UV-MS). Using this method, we found that CGA levels can vary greatly with leaf age, location on the leaf, and between plants. Therefore in order to observe the more subtle changes caused by bacterial treatments, it was essential to first be aware of the CGA variations in plants to find the most homogenous tissue to use. Ultimately, we found that leaf halves were most homogenous and adjacent panels on a same side of the midrib could be used for multiple sampling of a treatment over time. During this study we also found some interesting relationships regarding CGA distribution in the plant.},

Longitudinal studies of the genetic structure, complexity, infection dynamics, and duration of naturally acquired Plasmodium falciparum infections are needed to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of malaria epidemiology in the complex Kenyan highland eco-epidemiological systems where malaria recently expanded, as well as the evaluation of control measures. METHODS: We followed a cohort of 246 children residing in 3 villages at altitudes 1430 - 1580 m in western Kenya. Monthly parasitological surveys were undertaken for one year, yielding 866 P. falciparum isolates that were analyzed using 10 microsatellite markers. RESULTS: Infection complexity and genetic diversity were high (HE = 0.787-0.816), with ≥83\% of infections harboring more than one parasite clone. Diversity remained high even during the low malaria transmission season. There was no significant difference between levels of genetic diversity and population structure between high and low transmission seasons. Infection turn-over rate was high, with the average infection duration of single parasite genotypes being 1.11 months, and the longest genotype persistence was 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that despite the relatively recent spread of malaria to the highlands, parasite populations seem to have stabilized with no evidence of bottlenecks between seasons, while the ability of residents to clear or control infections indicates presence of effective anti-plasmodial immune mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Artemisinin partial resistance (ART-R) in Plasmodium falciparum is one of the most pressing threats to global malaria control. Over the last two decades, ART-R has spread widely across Southeast Asia, compromising public health strategies and hindering elimination efforts. As of 2024, ART-R has now emerged in East Africa, with the potential to dramatically increase human mortality in the region. Mitigating the spread of ART-R requires detailed genomic surveillance of point mutations in the kelch13 gene, the primary determinant of resistance to artemisinin derivatives. Although extensive surveillance data on these markers is available, it is distributed across many literature studies and open databases. In this literature review, we aggregate publicly available spatiotemporal data for 112,933 P. falciparum samples between 1980 – 2023 into a single resource, providing the most comprehensive overview of kelch13 markers to date. By synthesising insights from these samples over a global scale, we outline the history and current status of kelch13 mutations associated with ART-R, with particular reference to their emergence in Southeast Asia and recent emergence in East and Northeast Africa. Concerningly, we find their recent increases in frequency in these areas of Africa are comparable to those observed in Southeast Asia 10-15 years ago. We review several factors that may influence the spread of ART-R going forwards, such as fitness costs, treatment strategies, and local epidemiological dynamics, before articulating possible scenarios on how resistance may spread in Africa in coming years. In summary, this review provides a unified, comprehensive account of how the situation of ART-R has unfolded globally so far, highlighting insights both for researchers in the field and public health bodies which aim to reduce its negative effects. More broadly, we highlight the critical role genomic surveillance has had, and will continue to have in combating the spread of ART-R.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria risk can vary markedly between households in the same village, or between villages, but the determinants of this "micro-epidemiological" variation in malaria risk remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify factors that explain fine-scale variation in malaria risk across settings and improve definitions and methods for malaria micro-epidemiology. METHODS: A systematic review of studies that examined risk factors for variation in malaria infection between individuals, households, clusters, hotspots, or villages in any malaria-endemic setting was conducted. Four databases were searched for studies published up until 6th October 2015. Crude and adjusted effect estimates for risk factors for malaria infection were combined in random effects meta-analyses. Bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. RESULTS: From 743 retrieved records, 51 studies were selected, representing populations comprising over 160,000 individuals in 21 countries, in high- and low-endemicity settings. Sixty-five risk factors were identified and meta-analyses were conducted for 11 risk factors. Most studies focused on environmental factors, especially increasing distance from a breeding site (OR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.86-0.92, 10 studies). Individual bed net use was protective (OR 0.63, 95\% CI 0.52-0.77, 12 studies), but not household bed net ownership. Increasing household size (OR 1.08, 95\% CI 1.01-1.15, 4 studies) and household crowding (OR 1.79, 95\% CI 1.48-2.16, 4 studies) were associated with malaria infection. Health seeking behaviour, medical history and genetic traits were less frequently studied. Only six studies examined whether individual-level risk factors explained differences in malaria risk at village or hotspot level, and five studies reported different risk factors at different levels of analysis. The risk of bias varied from low to high in individual studies. Insufficient reporting and comparability of measurements limited the number of meta-analyses conducted. CONCLUSIONS: Several variables associated with individual-level malaria infection were identified, but there was limited evidence that these factors explain variation in malaria risk at village or hotspot level. Social, population and other factors may confound estimates of environmental risk factors, yet these variables are not included in many studies. A structured framework of malaria risk factors is proposed to improve study design and quality of evidence in future micro-epidemiological studies.},

Little is known about hotspot formation and stability in settings outside sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: Clustering of Plasmodium infections at the household and hotspot level was assessed over 2 years in 3 villages in eastern Cambodia. Social and spatial autocorrelation statistics were calculated to assess clustering of malaria risk, and logistic regression was used to assess the effect of living in a malaria hotspot compared to living in a malaria-positive household in the first year of the study on risk of malaria infection in the second year. RESULTS: The crude prevalence of Plasmodium infection was 8.4\% in 2016 and 3.6\% in 2017. Living in a hotspot in 2016 did not predict Plasmodium risk at the individual or household level in 2017 overall, but living in a Plasmodium-positive household in 2016 strongly predicted living in a Plasmodium-positive household in 2017 (Risk Ratio, 5.00 [95\% confidence interval, 2.09-11.96], P {$<$} .0001). There was no consistent evidence that malaria risk clustered in groups of socially connected individuals from different households. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria risk clustered more clearly in households than in hotspots over 2 years. Household-based strategies should be prioritized in malaria elimination programs in this region.},

There is evidence that warmer temperature due to climate change will influence the dengue transmission. However, long term scenario-based projections are yet to be developed. Here, we assessed the impact of weather variability on dengue transmission in a megacity of Dhaka, Bangladesh and projected the future dengue risk attributable to climate change. Our results show that weather variables particularly temperature and humidity were positively associated with dengue transmission. The effects of weather variables were observed at a lag of four months. We projected that assuming a temperature increase of 3.3°C without any adaptation measure and changes in socio-economic condition, there will be a projected increase of 16,030 dengue cases in Dhaka by the end of this century. This information might be helpful for the public health authorities to prepare for the likely increase of dengue due to climate change. The modelling framework used in this study may be applicable to dengue projection in other cities.},

  abstract = {Understanding the multiplicity of processes producing genetic patterns in natural populations can shed light on the ecology and evolution of species, and help guide effective management and conservation strategies. Here we investigated the role of environmental, demographic, and geographic factors in shaping the spatial patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation of the intertidal barnacle Notochthamalus scabrosus along the central-northern coast of Chile (28-34°S). We analyzed genetic data from 7 microsatellite loci genotyped for 300 individuals sampled from 10 sites and combined this information with 8 site-specific environmental (4), demographic (2), and geographic (2) variables using least squares linear regressions, generalized linear models, and matrix regression analyses. We found a strong association between the spatially structured genetic diversity of N. scabrosus and patterns of temporal variability in chlorophyll a, and among-site differences in seawater temperature and adult abundance. Our results illustrate that population size, partly driven by recruitment success, can leave a signal on genetic structure of this highly dispersive marine species. The significant effect of temperature and chlorophyll a stresses that local adaptation may be key to understanding the spatial genetic structure of our model species. Hence, the results of this work represent an advance towards understanding the usually complex causal relationships between environmental variables, gene flow, and genetic diversity patterns of coastal populations.},

This study aimed to determine the dispersal and origin of sulfadoxine resistance lineages in the Democratic Republic of the Congo compared with East African Plasmodium falciparum dihydropteroate synthetase (Pfdhps) haplotypes. The analysis involved 264 isolates collected from patients with uncomplicated malaria from Tanzania, Uganda and DR Congo. Isolates were genotyped for Pfdhps mutations at codons 436, 437, 540, 581 and 613. Three microsatellite loci (0.8, 4.3 and 7.7\,kb) flanking the Pfdhps gene were assayed. Evolutionary analysis revealed a shared origin of Pfdhps haplotypes in East Africa, with a distinct population clustering in DR Congo. Furthermore, in Tanzania there was an independent distinct origin of Pfdhps SGEGA resistant haplotype. In Uganda and Tanzania, gene flow patterns contribute to the dispersal and shared origin of parasites carrying double- and triple-mutant Pfdhps haplotypes associated with poor outcomes of intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy using SP (IPTp-SP). However, the origins of the Pfdhps haplotypes in DR Congo and Eastern Africa sites are different. The genetic structure demonstrated a divergent and distinct population cluster predominated by single-mutant Pfdhps haplotypes at the DR Congo site. This reflects the limited dispersal of double- and triple-mutant Pfdhps haplotypes in DR Congo. This study highlights the current genetic structure and dispersal of high-grade Pfdhps resistant haplotypes, which is important to guide implementation of SP in malaria chemoprevention strategies in the region.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: New frontier settlements across the Amazon Basin pose a major challenge for malaria elimination in Brazil. Here we describe the epidemiology of malaria during the early phases of occupation of farming settlements in Remansinho area, Brazilian Amazonia. We examine the relative contribution of low-density and asymptomatic parasitemias to the overall Plasmodium vivax burden over a period of declining transmission and discuss potential hurdles for malaria elimination in Remansinho and similar settings. METHODS: Eight community-wide cross-sectional surveys, involving 584 subjects, were carried out in Remansinho over 3 years and complemented by active and passive surveillance of febrile illnesses between the surveys. We used quantitative PCR to detect low-density asexual parasitemias and gametocytemias missed by conventional microscopy. Mixed-effects multiple logistic regression models were used to characterize independent risk factors for P. vivax infection and disease. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: P. vivax prevalence decreased from 23.8\% (March-April 2010) to 3.0\% (April-May 2013), with no P. falciparum infections diagnosed after March-April 2011. Although migrants from malaria-free areas were at increased risk of malaria, their odds of having P. vivax infection and disease decreased by 2-3\% with each year of residence in Amazonia. Several findings indicate that low-density and asymptomatic P. vivax parasitemias may complicate residual malaria elimination in Remansinho: (a) the proportion of subpatent infections (i.e. missed by microscopy) increased from 43.8\% to 73.1\% as P. vivax transmission declined; (b) most (56.6\%) P. vivax infections were asymptomatic and 32.8\% of them were both subpatent and asymptomatic; (c) asymptomatic parasite carriers accounted for 54.4\% of the total P. vivax biomass in the host population; (d) over 90\% subpatent and asymptomatic P. vivax had PCR-detectable gametocytemias; and (e) few (17.0\%) asymptomatic and subpatent P. vivax infections that were left untreated progressed to clinical disease over 6 weeks of follow-up and became detectable by routine malaria surveillance.},

  abstract = {Background Plasmodium vivax exacts a significant toll on health worldwide, yet few efforts to date have quantified the extent and temporal trends of its global distribution. Given the challenges associated with the proper diagnosis and treatment of P vivax, national malaria programmes—particularly those pursuing malaria elimination strategies—require up to date assessments of P vivax endemicity and disease impact. This study presents the first global maps of P vivax clinical burden from 2000 to 2017. Methods In this spatial and temporal modelling study, we adjusted routine malariometric surveillance data for known biases and used socioeconomic indicators to generate time series of the clinical burden of P vivax. These data informed Bayesian geospatial models, which produced fine-scale predictions of P vivax clinical incidence and infection prevalence over time. Within sub-Saharan Africa, where routine surveillance for P vivax is not standard practice, we combined predicted surfaces of Plasmodium falciparum with country-specific ratios of P vivax to P falciparum. These results were combined with surveillance-based outputs outside of Africa to generate global maps. Findings We present the first high-resolution maps of P vivax burden. These results are combined with those for P falciparum (published separately) to form the malaria estimates for the Global Burden of Disease 2017 study. The burden of P vivax malaria decreased by 41·6\%, from 24·5 million cases (95\% uncertainty interval 22·5–27·0) in 2000 to 14·3 million cases (13·7–15·0) in 2017. The Americas had a reduction of 56·8\% (47·6–67·0) in total cases since 2000, while South-East Asia recorded declines of 50·5\% (50·3–50·6) and the Western Pacific regions recorded declines of 51·3\% (48·0–55·4). Europe achieved zero P vivax cases during the study period. Nonetheless, rates of decline have stalled in the past five years for many countries, with particular increases noted in regions affected by political and economic instability. Interpretation Our study highlights important spatial and temporal patterns in the clinical burden and prevalence of P vivax. Amid substantial progress worldwide, plateauing gains and areas of increased burden signal the potential for challenges that are greater than expected on the road to malaria elimination. These results support global monitoring systems and can inform the optimisation of diagnosis and treatment where P vivax has most impact.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The proportion of individuals who seek treatment for fever is an important quantity in understanding access to and use of health systems, as well as for interpreting data on disease incidence from routine surveillance systems. For many malaria endemic countries (MECs), treatment-seeking information is available from national household surveys. The aim of this paper was to assemble sub-national estimates of treatment-seeking behaviours and to predict national treatment-seeking measures for all MECs lacking household survey data. METHODS: Data on treatment seeking for fever were obtained from Demographic and Health Surveys, Malaria Indicator Surveys and Multiple Cluster Indicator Surveys for every MEC and year that data were available. National-level social, economic and health-related variables were gathered from the World Bank as putative covariates of treatment-seeking rates. A generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) was used to estimate treatment-seeking behaviours for countries where survey data were unavailable. Two separate models were developed to predict the proportion of fever cases that would seek treatment at (1) a public health facility or (2) from any kind of treatment provider. RESULTS: Treatment-seeking data were available for 74 MECs and modelled for the remaining 24. GAMMs found that the percentage of pregnant women receiving prenatal care, vaccination rates, education level, government health expenditure, and GDP growth were important predictors for both categories of treatment-seeking outcomes. Treatment-seeking rates, which varied both within and among regions, revealed that public facilities were not always the primary facility type used. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of treatment-seeking rates show how health services are utilized and help correct reported malaria case numbers to obtain more accurate measures of disease burden. The assembled and modelled data demonstrated that while treatment-seeking rates have overall increased over time, access remains low in some malaria endemic regions and utilization of government services is in some areas limited.},

  abstract = {Satellite remote sensing has not been practical for agronomic research conducted using small plots due to spatial resolution issues. The objectives were to determine, (1) the potential use of QuickBird high resolution multispectral images for estimating available nitrogen (N) at planting, leaf N content at the tassel (VT) growth stage, and yield (biomass and grain) of irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) grown in research size plots and (2), if image digital number (DN) values were adequate for assessing these agronomic parameters. Conventionally-tilled plots 21.3 m × 21.6 m, 10.7 m × 43.3 m, and 10.7 m × 21.6 m were used. QuickBird images (2.5 m pixel resolution) were obtained at the VT growth stage for two growing seasons along with ground-based reflectance for one growing season. Multispectral data [blue (450-520), green (520-600), red (630-690), and near-infrared (760-900 nm)] was acquired by both sources. Relative green (G) waveband DN had the highest correlations with available N at planting (r2 = 0.91), relative grain yield (r2 = 0.81) and relative total biomass (r2 = 0.59) than any of the other indices investigated. Relative spectral indices containing G and near-infrared (NIR) wavebands, i.e., the green normalised difference vegetation index (GNDVI), the NIR/G ratio and the chlorophyll index ((NIR/G)-1) produced good correlations with leaf N content at VT (r2 {$>$} 0.7). Regression parameters (slopes and intercepts) of the normalised (NIR/G)-1 index calculated from satellite DN values and ground-based reflectance versus leaf N content were not significantly different (α = 0.01). Results indicate that QuickBird multispectral images show promise for estimating agronomic parameters from small plot research. Additional research is required to expand the results to more maize growth stages and other crops.},

  abstract = {Comparison of the performance and accuracy of different inference methods, such as maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference, is difficult because the inference methods are implemented in different programs, often written by different authors. Both methods were implemented in the program MIGRATE, that estimates population genetic parameters, such as population sizes and migration rates, using coalescence theory. Both inference methods use the same Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and differ from each other in only two aspects: parameter proposal distribution and maximization of the likelihood function. Using simulated datasets, the Bayesian method generally fares better than the ML approach in accuracy and coverage, although for some values the two approaches are equal in performance. MOTIVATION: The Markov chain Monte Carlo-based ML framework can fail on sparse data and can deliver non-conservative support intervals. A Bayesian framework with appropriate prior distribution is able to remedy some of these problems. RESULTS: The program MIGRATE was extended to allow not only for ML(-) maximum likelihood estimation of population genetics parameters but also for using a Bayesian framework. Comparisons between the Bayesian approach and the ML approach are facilitated because both modes estimate the same parameters under the same population model and assumptions.},

These sampling locations often do not reflect the genetic population structure. We describe a framework using marginal likelihoods to compare and order structured population models, such as testing whether the sampling locations belong to the same randomly mating population or comparing unidirectional and multidirectional gene flow models. In the context of inferences employing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, the accuracy of the marginal likelihoods depends heavily on the approximation method used to calculate the marginal likelihood. Two methods, modified thermodynamic integration and a stabilized harmonic mean estimator, are compared. With finite Markov chain Monte Carlo run lengths, the harmonic mean estimator may not be consistent. Thermodynamic integration, in contrast, delivers considerably better estimates of the marginal likelihood. The choice of prior distributions does not influence the order and choice of the better models when the marginal likelihood is estimated using thermodynamic integration, whereas with the harmonic mean estimator the influence of the prior is pronounced and the order of the models changes. The approximation of marginal likelihood using thermodynamic integration in MIGRATE allows the evaluation of complex population genetic models, not only of whether sampling locations belong to a single panmictic population, but also of competing complex structured population models.},

This reduces the efficacy of control strategies, but focusing control strategies on clusters or ‘hotspots’ of transmission may be highly effective. Among 1500 homesteads in coastal Kenya we calculated (a) the fraction of febrile children with positive malaria smears per homestead, and (b) the mean age of children with malaria per homestead. These two measures were inversely correlated, indicating that children in homesteads at higher transmission acquire immunity more rapidly. This inverse correlation increased gradually with increasing spatial scale of analysis, and hotspots of febrile malaria were identified at every scale. We found hotspots within hotspots, down to the level of an individual homestead. Febrile malaria hotspots were temporally unstable, but 4 km radius hotspots could be targeted for 1 month following 1 month periods of surveillance.},

  abstract = {Recently admixed populations offer unique opportunities for studying human history and for elucidating the genetic basis of complex traits that differ in prevalence between human populations. Historical records, classical protein markers, and preliminary genetic data indicate that the Cape Verde islands in West Africa are highly admixed and primarily descended from European males and African females. However, little is known about the variation in admixture levels, admixture dynamics and genetic diversity across the islands, or about the potential of Cape Verde for admixture mapping studies. We have performed a detailed analysis of phenotypic and genetic variation in Cape Verde based on objective skin color measurements, socio-economic status (SES) evaluations and data for 50 autosomal, 34 X-chromosome, and 21 non-recombinant Y-chromosome (NRY) markers in 845 individuals from six islands of the archipelago. We find extensive genetic admixture between European and African ancestral populations (mean West African ancestry = 0.57, sd = 0.08), with individual African ancestry proportions varying considerably among the islands. African ancestry proportions calculated with X and Y-chromosome markers confirm that the pattern of admixture has been sex-biased. The high-resolution NRY-STRs reveal additional patterns of variation among the islands that are most consistent with differentiation after admixture. The differences in the autosomal admixture proportions are clearly evident in the skin color distribution across the islands (Pearson r = 0.54, P-value{$<$}2e–16). Despite this strong correlation, there are significant interactions between SES and skin color that are independent of the relationship between skin color and genetic ancestry. The observed distributions of admixture, genetic variation and skin color and the relationship of skin color with SES relate to historical and social events taking place during the settlement history of Cape Verde, and have implications for the design of association studies using this population.},

  abstract = {Humans and animals often become coinfected with pathogen strains that differ in virulence. The ensuing interaction between these strains can, in theory, be a major determinant of the direction of selection on virulence genes in pathogen populations. Many mathematical analyses of this assume that virulent pathogen lineages have a competitive advantage within coinfected hosts and thus predict that pathogens will evolve to become more virulent where genetically diverse infections are common. Although the implications of these studies are relevant to both fundamental biology and medical science, direct empirical tests for relationships between virulence and competitive ability are lacking. Here we use newly developed strain-specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction protocols to determine the pairwise competitiveness of genetically divergent Plasmodium chabaudi clones that represent a wide range of innate virulences in their rodent host. We found that even against their background of widely varying genotypic and antigenic properties, virulent clones had a competitive advantage in the acute phase of mixed infections. The more virulent a clone was relative to its competitor, the less it suffered from competition. This result confirms our earlier work with parasite lines derived from a single clonal lineage by serial passage and supports the virulence-competitive ability assumption of many theoretical models. To the extent that our rodent model captures the essence of the natural history of malaria parasites, public health interventions which reduce the incidence of mixed malaria infections should have beneficial consequences by reducing the selection for high virulence.},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) became popular platforms for the collection of remotely sensed geodata in the last years (Hardin \& Jensen 2011). Various applications in numerous fields of research like archaeology (Hendrickx et al., 2011), forestry or geomorphology evolved (Martinsanz, 2012). This contribution deals with the generation of multi-temporal crop surface models (CSMs) with very high resolution by means of low-cost equipment. The concept of the generation of multi-temporal CSMs using Terrestrial Laserscanning (TLS) has already been introduced by Hoffmeister et al. (2010). For this study, data acquisition was performed with a low-cost and low-weight Mini-UAV ({$<$} 5kg). UAVs in general and especially smaller ones, like the system presented here, close a gap in small scale remote sensing (Berni et al., 2009; Watts et al., 2012). In precision agriculture frequent remote sensing on such scales during the vegetation period provides important spatial information on the crop status. Crop growth variability can be detected by comparison of the CSMs in different phenological stages. Here, the focus is on the detection of this variability and its dependency on cultivar and plant treatment. The method has been tested for data acquired on a barley experiment field in Germany. In this contribution, it is applied to a different crop in a different environment. The study area is an experiment field for rice in Northeast China (Sanjiang Plain). Three replications of the cultivars Kongyu131 and Longjing21 were planted in plots that were treated with different amounts of N-fertilizer. In July 2012 three UAV-campaigns were carried out. Establishment of ground control points (GCPs) allowed for ground truth. Additionally, further destructive and non-destructive field data were collected. The UAV-system is an MK-Okto by Hisystems (www.mikrokopter.de) which was equipped with the high resolution Panasonic Lumix GF3 12 megapixel consumer camera. The self-built and self-maintained system has a payload of up to 1 kg and an average flight time of 15 minutes. The maximum speed is around 30 km/h and the system can be operated up to a wind speed of less than 19 km/h (Beaufort scale number 3 for wind speed). Using a suitable flight plan stereo images can be captured. For this study, a flying height of 50 m and a 44\% side and 90\% forward overlap was chosen. The images are processed into CSMs under the use of the Structure from Motion (SfM)-based software Agisoft Photoscan 0.9.0. The resulting models have a resolution of 0.02 m and an average number of about 12 million points. Further data processing in Esri ArcGIS allows for quantitative comparison of the plant heights. The multi-temporal datasets are analysed on a plot size basis. The results can be compared to and combined with the additional field data. Detecting plant height with non-invasive measurement techniques enables analysis of its correlation to biomass and other crop parameters (Hansen \& Schjoerring, 2003; Thenkabail et al., 2000) measured in the field. The method presented here can therefore be a valuable addition for the recognition of such correlations.},

We model tandem repeats by percent identity and frequency of indels between adjacent pattern copies and use statistically based recognition criteria. We demonstrate the algorithm's speed and its ability to detect tandem repeats that have undergone extensive mutational change by analyzing four sequences: the human frataxin gene, the human beta T cellreceptor locus sequence and two yeast chromosomes.

Using data from multiple sources, we generate high-resolution maps of ITN access, use, and nets-per-capita annually from 2000 to 2020 across the 40 highest-burden African countries. Our findings support several existing hypotheses: that use is high among those with access, that nets are discarded more quickly than official policy presumes, and that effectively distributing nets grows more difficult as coverage increases. The primary driving factors behind these findings are most likely strong cultural and social messaging around the importance of net use, low physical net durability, and a mixture of inherent commodity distribution challenges and less-than-optimal net allocation policies, respectively. These results can inform both policy decisions and downstream malaria analyses.},

The technique is applied to a case study that examines erosion in 26 gullies in two study areas in the upper Waipaoa catchment, eastern North Island, New Zealand. Changes over two consecutive time periods, ranging in length from 14.0 years to 33.2 years, were studied at each site, drawing on available historical aerial photography. Several key aspects of the method used are described and discussed in detail, and recommendations are made for future application of DEMs for assessment of landscape change. DEM-measured gully degradation rates are directly proportional to the square root of the gully area.From this relationship it should be possible to rapidly estimate gully erosion at a catchment scale on the basis of gully areas alone. DEM-based measurement techniques, together with appropriate consideration for the sensitivity of the method, have significant cost and efficiency advantages over manual approaches to erosion measurements.},

  abstract = {High-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) were derived from sequential aerial photography of an active fluvio-mass movement (gully) complex in New Zealand's North Island East Coast region, to measure geomorphic changes over approximately one year. The gully showed a complex behaviour, combining fluvial and mass movement erosion, deposition, and reworking of materials stored in an active debris fan. During the measurement period 5200 ± 1700 m3 of material were eroded from the 8·7 ha gully complex and 670 ± 180 m3 from the 0·8 ha depositional fan, giving a total of 5870 ± 1710 m3 for the entire gully complex-fan system.The results provide a high-resolution description of gully behaviour over a short time period, and also demonstrate that mass movement (slumping and debris flows) accounted for almost 90 per cent (4660 ± 200 m3) of the sediment generated. This erosional response is described in terms of gully evolution by comparing the gully complex to other systems in the region in various stages of development. The effect of gully evolution on geomorphic coupling between the gully complex and channel system is described, and coupling is also shown to vary with the magnitude and frequency of rainfall events.From a land management perspective the success of strategies, such as tree planting, to mitigate against gully erosion depends on the stage of gully development - particularly on whether or not mass movement erosion has begun. In contrast to gully rehabilitation efforts elsewhere, basin-wide afforestation in the early stages of gully incision is favoured over riparian planting, given that mass movement assisted by excessive groundwater pressure is the main process leading to uncontrollable gully expansion.To protect land effectively against continuing gully erosion of headwater catchments and resulting downstream aggradation, it is necessary for land managers to understand the spatial and temporal variability of gully development fully so that mitigation efforts can be targeted appropriately.

In continuously exposed communities, polyclonal infections are thought to reduce the risk of severe disease and promote the establishment of asymptomatic infections. We sought to investigate the relationship between the complexity of P. falciparum infection and underlying host adaptive immune responses in an area with a high prevalence of asymptomatic parasitaemia in Cameroon. A cross-sectional study of 353 individuals aged 2 to 86 years (median age = 16 years) was conducted in five villages in the Centre Region of Cameroon. Plasmodium falciparum infection was detected by multiplex nested PCR in 316 samples, of which 278 were successfully genotyped. Of these, 60.1\% (167/278) were polyclonal infections, the majority (80.2\%) of which were from asymptomatic carriers. Host-parasite factors associated with polyclonal infection in the study population included peripheral blood parasite density, participant age and village of residence. The number of parasite clones per infected sample increased significantly with parasite density (r = 0.3912, p {$<$} 0.0001) but decreased with participant age (r = -0.4860, p {$<$} 0.0001). Parasitaemia and the number of clones per sample correlated negatively with total plasma levels of IgG antibodies to three highly reactive P. falciparum antigens (MSP-1p19, MSP-3 and EBA175) and two soluble antigen extracts (merozoite and mixed stage antigens). Surprisingly, we observed no association between the frequency of polyclonal infection and susceptibility to clinical disease as assessed by the recent occurrence of malarial symptoms or duration since the previous fever episode. Overall, the data indicate that in areas with the high perennial transmission of P. falciparum, parasite polyclonality is dependent on underlying host antibody responses, with the majority of polyclonal infections occurring in persons with low levels of protective anti-plasmodial antibodies.},

  abstract = {The spread of parasites is inherently a spatial process often embedded in physically complex landscapes. It is therefore not surprising that infectious disease researchers are increasingly taking a landscape genetics perspective to elucidate mechanisms underlying basic ecological processes driving infectious disease dynamics and to understand the linkage between spatially dependent population processes and the geographic distribution of genetic variation within both hosts and parasites. The increasing availability of genetic information on hosts and parasites when coupled to their ecological interactions can lead to insights for predicting patterns of disease emergence, spread and control. Here, we review research progress in this area based on four different motivations for the application of landscape genetics approaches: (i) assessing the spatial organization of genetic variation in parasites as a function of environmental variability, (ii) using host population genetic structure as a means to parameterize ecological dynamics that indirectly influence parasite populations, for example, gene flow and movement pathways across heterogeneous landscapes and the concurrent transport of infectious agents, (iii) elucidating the temporal and spatial scales of disease processes and (iv) reconstructing and understanding infectious disease invasion. Throughout this review, we emphasize that landscape genetic principles are relevant to infection dynamics across a range of scales from within host dynamics to global geographic patterns and that they can also be applied to unconventional 'landscapes' such as heterogeneous contact networks underlying the spread of human and livestock diseases. We conclude by discussing some general considerations and problems for inferring epidemiological processes from genetic data and try to identify possible future directions and applications for this rapidly expanding field.},

Recent work has shown that mosquito and parasite biology are influenced not only by average temperature, but also by the extent of the daily temperature variation. Here we examine how parasite development within the mosquito (Extrinsic Incubation Period) is expected to vary over time and space depending on the diurnal temperature range and baseline mean temperature in Kenya and across Africa. Our results show that under cool conditions, the typical approach of using mean monthly temperatures alone to characterize the transmission environment will underestimate parasite development. In contrast, under warmer conditions, the use of mean temperatures will overestimate development. Qualitatively similar patterns hold using both outdoor and indoor temperatures. These findings have important implications for defining malaria risk. Furthermore, understanding the influence of daily temperature dynamics could provide new insights into ectotherm ecology both now and in response to future climate change.},

Since the biology of DNA for eukaryotic pathogens differs substantially from that of bacteria, the analytic approach to their molecular epidemiology can also differ. While many of the genotyping techniques presented earlier in this series, "Advances in Molecular Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases," can be applied to eukaryotes, the output must be interpreted in the light of how DNA is distributed from one generation to the next. In some cases, parasite populations can be evaluated in ways reminiscent of bacteria. They differ, however, when analyzed as sexually reproducing organisms, where all individuals are unique but the genetic composition of the population does not change unless a limited set of events occurs. It is these events (migration, mutation, nonrandom mating, selection, and genetic drift) that are of interest. At a given time, not all of them are likely to be equally important, so the list can easily be narrowed down to understand the driving forces behind the population as it is now and even what it will look like in the future. The main population characteristics measured to assess these events are differentiation and diversity, interpreted in the light of what is known about the population from observation. The population genetics of eukaryotes is important for planning and evaluation of control measures, surveillance, outbreak investigation, and monitoring of the development and spread of drug resistance. *This article is part of a curated collection.},

  abstract = {Preprocessing forms an oft-neglected foundation for a wide range of statistical and scientific analyses. However, it is rife with subtleties and pitfalls. Decisions made in preprocessing constrain all later analyses and are typically irreversible. Hence, data analysis becomes a collaborative endeavor by all parties involved in data collection, preprocessing and curation, and downstream inference. Even if each party has done its best given the information and resources available to them, the final result may still fall short of the best possible in the traditional single-phase inference framework. This is particularly relevant as we enter the era of "big data". The technologies driving this data explosion are subject to complex new forms of measurement error. Simultaneously, we are accumulating increasingly massive databases of scientific analyses. As a result, preprocessing has become more vital (and potentially more dangerous) than ever before. We propose a theoretical framework for the analysis of preprocessing under the banner of multiphase inference. We provide some initial theoretical foundations for this area, including distributed preprocessing, building upon previous work in multiple imputation. We motivate this foundation with two problems from biology and astrophysics, illustrating multiphase pitfalls and potential solutions. These examples also emphasize the motivations behind multiphase analyses—both practical and theoretical. We demonstrate that multiphase inferences can, in some cases, even surpass standard single-phase estimators in efficiency and robustness. Our work suggests several rich paths for further research into the statistical principles underlying preprocessing. To tackle our increasingly complex and massive data, we must ensure that our inferences are built upon solid inputs and sound principles. Principled investigation of preprocessing is thus a vital direction for statistical research.},

These tree collections allow for inference of nonvertical evolution, but only indirectly, making findings difficult to interpret and models difficult to generalize. An alternative approach to explore nonvertical evolution relies on phylogenetic networks. These networks provide a framework to model nonvertical evolution but leave unanswered questions such as the statistical significance of specific nonvertical events. In this paper, we begin to correct the shortcomings of both approaches by introducing the "stochastic model for reassortment and transfer events" (SMARTIE) drawing upon ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs). ARGs are directed graphs that allow for formal probabilistic inference on vertical speciation events and nonvertical evolutionary events. We apply SMARTIE to phylogenetic data. Because of this, we can typically infer a single most probable ARG, avoiding coarse population dynamic summary statistics. In addition, a focus on phylogenetic data suggests novel probability distributions on ARGs. To make inference with our model, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler to approximate the posterior distribution of SMARTIE. Using the BEAST phylogenetic software as a foundation, the sampler employs a parallel computing approach that allows for inference on large-scale data sets. To demonstrate SMARTIE, we explore 2 separate phylogenetic applications, one involving pathogenic Leptospirochete and the other Saccharomyces.},

However, a mismatch of these models' typical spatial resolutions and the characteristic scale of malaria vector population dynamics may confound disease risk predictions in areas of high spatial hydrological variability such as the Sahel region of Africa. Methods: Field observations spanning two years from two Niger villages are compared. The two villages are separated by only 30 km but exhibit a ten-fold difference in anopheles mosquito density. These two villages would be covered by a single grid cell in many malaria models, yet their entomological activity differs greatly. Environmental conditions and associated entomological activity are simulated at high spatial- and temporal resolution using a mechanistic approach that couples a distributed hydrology scheme and an entomological model. Model results are compared to regular field observations of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato mosquito populations and local hydrology. The model resolves the formation and persistence of individual pools that facilitate mosquito breeding and predicts spatio-temporal mosquito population variability at high resolution using an agent-based modeling approach. Results: Observations of soil moisture, pool size, and pool persistence are reproduced by the model. The resulting breeding of mosquitoes in the simulated pools yields time-integrated seasonal mosquito population dynamics that closely follow observations from captured mosquito abundance. Interannual difference in mosquito abundance is simulated, and the inter-village difference in mosquito population is reproduced for two years of observations. These modeling results emulate the known focal nature of malaria in Niger Sahel villages. Conclusion: Hydrological variability must be represented at high spatial and temporal resolution to achieve accurate predictive ability of malaria risk at the village scale, which can then be integrated appropriately to regional spatial scales and seasonal temporal scales. These results have important implications for models seeking to link the impacts of climate change and climate variability to malaria transmission. The highly focal nature of malaria in the Sahel makes detailed representation necessary to evaluate village-level risks associated with hydrology-related vector population variability.},

The number of oocysts in oocyst-positive mosquitoes developing from a single, naturally acquired infectious blood meal (herein referred to as a single-feed infection load) greatly influences the efficacy of transmission blocking interventions but still remains poorly documented. During a year-long analysis of malaria parasite transmission in Burkina Faso we caught and dissected wild malaria vectors to assess Plasmodium oocyst prevalence and load (the number of oocysts counted in mosquitoes with detectable oocysts) and the prevalence of salivary gland sporozoites. This was compared with malaria endemicity in the human population, assessed in cross-sectional surveys. Data were analysed using a novel transmission mathematical model to estimate the per bite transmission probability and the average single-feed infection load for each location. The observed oocyst load and the estimated single-feed infection load in naturally infected mosquitoes were substantially higher than previous estimates (means ranging from 3.2 to 24.5 according to seasons and locations) and indicate a strong positive association between the single-feed infection load and parasite prevalence in humans. This work suggests that highly infected mosquitoes are not rare in the field and might have a greater influence on the epidemiology and genetics of the parasite, and on the efficacy of novel transmission blocking interventions.},

  abstract = {The Mantel correlogram is an elegant way to compute a correlogram for multivariate data. However, recent papers raised concerns about the power of the Mantel test itself. Hence the question: Is the Mantel correlogram powerful enough to be useful? To explore this issue, we compared the performances of the Mantel correlogram to those of other methods, using numerical simulations based on random, normally distributed data. For a single response variable, we compared it to the Moran and Geary correlograms. Type I error rates of the three methods were correct. Power of the Mantel correlogram was nearly as high as that of the univariate methods. For the multivariate case, the test of the multivariate variogram developed in the context of multiscale ordination is in fact a Mantel test, so that the power of the two methods is the same by definition. We devised an alternative permutation test based on the variance, which yielded similar results. Overall, the power of the Mantel test was high, the method successfully detecting spatial correlation at rates similar to the permutation test of the variance statistic in multivariate variograms. We conclude that the Mantel correlogram deserves its place in the ecologist's toolbox.},

The proposed new methods are included within the ade4 package widely used thanks to its great variety of multivariate methods. These methods are available on the one hand for statisticians and on the other hand for users from various fields in the sense that all the values derived from the multiblock processing are available. Some relevant interpretation tools are also developed. Finally the main results are summarized using overall graphical displays.

Genetic structure result from gene flow and other evolutionary and demographic processes over many generations, while dispersal predicted from the mobile phase often represents solely one generation on a single time-step. In this study, we present a spatial graph approach to landscape genetics that extends connectivity networks with a stepping-stone model to represent dispersal between suitable habitat patches over multiple generations. We illustrate the approach with the case of the striped red mullet Mullus surmuletus in the Mediterranean Sea. The genetic connectivity of M. surmuletus was not correlate with the estimated dispersal probability over one generation, but with the stepping-stone estimate of larval dispersal, revealing the temporal scale of connectivity across the Mediterranean Sea. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple generations and different time scales when relating demographic and genetic connectivity. The spatial graph of genetic distances further untangles intra-population genetic structure revealing the Siculo-Tunisian Strait as an important corridor rather than a barrier for gene flow between the Western- and Eastern Mediterranean basins, and identifying Mediterranean islands as important stepping-stones for gene flow between continental populations. Our approach can be easily extended to other systems and environments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission is highly heterogeneous, generating malaria hotspots that can fuel malaria transmission across a wider area. Targeting hotspots may represent an efficacious strategy for reducing malaria transmission. We determined the impact of interventions targeted to serologically defined malaria hotspots on malaria transmission both inside hotspots and in surrounding communities. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Twenty-seven serologically defined malaria hotspots were detected in a survey conducted from 24 June to 31 July 2011 that included 17,503 individuals from 3,213 compounds in a 100-km2 area in Rachuonyo South District, Kenya. In a cluster-randomized trial from 22 March to 15 April 2012, we randomly allocated five clusters to hotspot-targeted interventions with larviciding, distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying, and focal mass drug administration (2,082 individuals in 432 compounds); five control clusters received malaria control following Kenyan national policy (2,468 individuals in 512 compounds). Our primary outcome measure was parasite prevalence in evaluation zones up to 500 m outside hotspots, determined by nested PCR (nPCR) at baseline and 8 wk (16 June-6 July 2012) and 16 wk (21 August-10 September 2012) post-intervention by technicians blinded to the intervention arm. Secondary outcome measures were parasite prevalence inside hotpots, parasite prevalence in the evaluation zone as a function of distance from the hotspot boundary, Anopheles mosquito density, mosquito breeding site productivity, malaria incidence by passive case detection, and the safety and acceptability of the interventions. Intervention coverage exceeded 87\% for all interventions. Hotspot-targeted interventions did not result in a change in nPCR parasite prevalence outside hotspot boundaries (p ≥ 0.187). We observed an average reduction in nPCR parasite prevalence of 10.2\% (95\% CI -1.3 to 21.7\%) inside hotspots 8 wk post-intervention that was statistically significant after adjustment for covariates (p = 0.024), but not 16 wk post-intervention (p = 0.265). We observed no statistically significant trend in the effect of the intervention on nPCR parasite prevalence in the evaluation zone in relation to distance from the hotspot boundary 8 wk (p = 0.27) or 16 wk post-intervention (p = 0.75). Thirty-six patients with clinical malaria confirmed by rapid diagnostic test could be located to intervention or control clusters, with no apparent difference between the study arms. In intervention clusters we caught an average of 1.14 female anophelines inside hotspots and 0.47 in evaluation zones; in control clusters we caught an average of 0.90 female anophelines inside hotspots and 0.50 in evaluation zones, with no apparent difference between study arms. Our trial was not powered to detect subtle effects of hotspot-targeted interventions nor designed to detect effects of interventions over multiple transmission seasons. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high coverage, the impact of interventions targeting malaria vectors and human infections on nPCR parasite prevalence was modest, transient, and restricted to the targeted hotspot areas. Our findings suggest that transmission may not primarily occur from hotspots to the surrounding areas and that areas with highly heterogeneous but widespread malaria transmission may currently benefit most from an untargeted community-wide approach. Hotspot-targeted approaches may have more validity in settings where human settlement is more nuclear. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01575613.},

  abstract = {In nature, opportunities are limited for recording the response to a rapid ongoing base-level fall and for examining its effects on channel evolution during the process. Following a dramatic base-level fall, the natural laboratory area of the Dead Sea offers such an opportunity. Classical shape evolution models of incised channels describe the response to an "impulse" type base-level drop after it became stabilized. The Dead Sea delineates during its continuous level drop a different mode of adjustment from those previously conceptualized. We have recorded the entrenchment rates of channels and their transient shape evolution "at a station" in real time, i.e., during the ongoing base-level fall. This study represents the first attempt to apply integrated time series of high resolution DEMs, change detection maps, Differential Global Position System measurements, and field methods to monitor vertical and horizontal entrenchment rates, as well as the evolution of the cross-sectional shape of channels in response to a continuous and rapidly lowering base level. Mean vertical entrenchment rates are very high, 0.4-0.8 m/y, and widening rates are even higher (2.1-24 m/y). Elevation-change detection maps demonstrate along banks a patchy pattern of channel entrenchment, indicating the initial widening stage. The incised channels have a trapezoidal, gorge-like, cross-sectional form, i.e., they have developed beyond the initial stage of net vertical incision. However, neither advanced channel widening nor development of an inner floodplain has been observed. We conclude that widening is yet ineffective in damping the vertical adjustment. The continuous and rapid lowering of the Dead Sea level entraps the drainage systems in the vertical incision mode, preventing the evolutionary progression toward a wide, graded, and stable geometry which has been conceptualized in existing models.},

Empirical studies often seek to investigate the relationship between genetic differentiation and some ecological variable(s) while accounting for geographic distance, but common approaches to this problem (such as the partial Mantel test) have a number of drawbacks. In this article, we present a Bayesian method that enables users to quantify the relative contributions of geographic distance and ecological distance to genetic differentiation between sampled populations or individuals. We model the allele frequencies in a set of populations at a set of unlinked loci as spatially correlated Gaussian processes, in which the covariance structure is a decreasing function of both geographic and ecological distance. Parameters of the model are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We call this method Bayesian Estimation of Differentiation in Alleles by Spatial Structure and Local Ecology (BEDASSLE), and have implemented it in a user-friendly format in the statistical platform R. We demonstrate its utility with a simulation study and empirical applications to human and teosinte data sets.},

  abstract = {The measurement and recording of the height and spatial extent reached by coastal storm surges is fundamental to scientific progress in understanding these phenomena. Such information is required for better prediction and for risk assessment. Model-based evaluation of increasing delta vulnerability, for example, cannot be tested without long-term, consistent, and sustained observation of actual events. Also, storm surges occur within the temporal context of tidal variation, which must first be characterized through observation. Present standard approaches for measuring storm surges are not optimum. Thus, tidal gauges provide information at one point, whereas the heights reached by surges vary spatially. Also, post-surge ground surveys are expensive, laborious, and commonly lack comparison to similar data obtained for previous surges or for high tides. The advent of moderate spatial resolution, high temporal resolution remote sensing initiated by the launch of the two NASA MODIS sensors greatly reduces these constraints. For over a decade, daily coverage of most coastal land areas, though restricted by cloud cover, has systematically captured the maximum extents reached by both high tides and by storm surges. Automated water classification algorithms are now transforming the incoming image data into GIS water boundary files, again at daily or near-daily time steps. This paper provides a retrospective view of sample storm surges as mapped via these sensors and describes: (a) the present, MODIS-based surface water surveillance system, (b) the mapping enhancement to be provided by frequent-repeat, wide-swath satellite radar imaging, and (c) the emerging prospects for routine global surveillance of storm surge events. Such will be necessary if long-term trends are to be recognized, characterized, and understood, along coastal zones now being affected by both increasing subsidence and rising sea level.},

  abstract = {It is a long recognized fact that climatic variations, especially temperature, affect the life history of biting insects. This is particularly important when considering vector-borne diseases, especially in temperate regions where climatic fluctuations are large. In general, it has been found that most biological processes occur at a faster rate at higher temperatures, although not all processes change in the same manner. This differential response to temperature, often considered as a trade-off between onward transmission and vector life expectancy, leads to the total transmission potential of an infected vector being maximized at intermediate temperatures. Here we go beyond the concept of a static optimal temperature, and mathematically model how realistic temperature variation impacts transmission dynamics. We use bluetongue virus (BTV), under UK temperatures and transmitted by Culicoides midges, as a well-studied example where temperature fluctuations play a major role. We first consider an optimal temperature profile that maximizes transmission, and show that this is characterized by a warm day to maximize biting followed by cooler weather to maximize vector life expectancy. This understanding can then be related to recorded representative temperature patterns for England, the UK region which has experienced BTV cases, allowing us to infer historical transmissibility of BTV, as well as using forecasts of climate change to predict future transmissibility. Our results show that when BTV first invaded northern Europe in 2006 the cumulative transmission intensity was higher than any point in the last 50 years, although with climate change such high risks are the expected norm by 2050. Such predictions would indicate that regular BTV epizootics should be expected in the UK in the future.},

  abstract = {Plasmodium vivax has become the predominant malaria parasite and a major challenge for malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Yet, our knowledge about the evolution of P. vivax populations in the GMS is fragmental. We performed whole genome sequencing on 23 P. vivax samples from the China-Myanmar border (CMB) and used 21 high-coverage samples to compare to over 200 samples from the rest of the GMS. Using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we analyzed population differentiation, genetic structure, migration and potential selection using an array of methods. The CMB parasites displayed a higher proportion of monoclonal infections, and 52\% shared over 90\% of their genomes in identity-by-descent segments with at least one other sample from the CMB, suggesting preferential expansion of certain parasite strains in this region, likely resulting from the P. vivax outbreaks occurring during this study period. Principal component, admixture, fixation index and phylogenetic analyses all identified that parasites from the CMB were genetically distinct from parasites from eastern parts of the GMS (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand), whereas the eastern GMS parasite populations were largely undifferentiated. Such a genetic differentiation pattern of the P. vivax populations from the GMS parasite was largely explainable through geographic distance. Using the genome-wide SNPs, we narrowed down to a set of 36 SNPs for differentiating parasites from different areas of the GMS. Genome-wide scans to determine selection in the genome with two statistical methods identified genes potentially under drug selection, including genes associated with antifolate resistance and genes linked to chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum.},

Biological features such as association with low-density infection and the formation of hypnozoites responsible for relapse make their elimination challenging. Studies on these parasites rely primarily on clinical samples due to the lack of long-term culture techniques. With improved methods to enrich parasite DNA from clinical samples, whole-genome sequencing of the neglected malaria parasites has gained increasing popularity. Population genomics of more than 2200 P. vivax global isolates has improved our knowledge of parasite biology and host-parasite interactions, identified vaccine targets and potential drug resistance markers, and provided a new way to track parasite migration and introduction and monitor the evolutionary response of local populations to elimination efforts. Here, we review advances in population genomics for neglected malaria parasites, discuss how the rich genomic information is being used to understand parasite biology and epidemiology, and explore opportunities for the applications of malaria genomic data in malaria elimination practice.},

Although Ethiopia has an overall lower prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum among countries in Africa, the emergence of drug resistance could seriously hinder elimination efforts. Using samples collected from five therapeutic efficacy studies conducted in 2007–11, we evaluated the prevalence of putative drug resistance mutations in the pfcrt, pfmdr1, and kelch13 genes at the time of those studies, as well as the ama1 gene for genetic relatedness using a pooled amplicon deep sequencing approach. Among all sites, the kelch13 gene showed no mutations, whereas the pfcrt CVIET genotype was fixed in all populations. By contrast, the mdr1 gene demonstrated frequencies of resistant genotypes ranging from 10 to 100\% at amino acid position 86 and from 0\% to 57.8\% at amino acid position 1246. Although we observed a low degree of haplotype sharing between sites, we did observe considerable haplotype sharing within sites over time. This suggests that P. falciparum populations in Ethiopia are isolated and able to persist through time.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evaluation of genetic relatedness of malaria parasites is a useful tool for understanding transmission patterns, but patterns are not easily detectable in areas with moderate to high malaria transmission. To evaluate the feasibility of detecting genetic relatedness in a moderate malaria transmission setting, relatedness of Plasmodium falciparum infections was measured in cohort participants from randomly selected households in the Kihihi sub-county of Uganda (annual entomological inoculation rate of 27~infectious bites per person). METHODS: All infections detected via microscopy or Plasmodium-specific loop mediated isothermal amplification from passive and active case detection during August 2011-March 2012 were genotyped at 26 microsatellite loci, providing data for 349 samples from 230 participants living in 80 households. Pairwise genetic relatedness was calculated using identity by state (IBS). RESULTS: As expected, genetic diversity was high (mean heterozygosity [He]\,=\,0.73), and the majority (76.5\,\%) of samples were polyclonal. Despite the high genetic diversity, fine-scale population structure was detectable, with significant spatiotemporal clustering of highly related infections. Although the difference in malaria incidence between households at higher (mean 1127 metres) versus lower elevation (mean 1015 metres) was modest (1.4 malaria cases per person-year vs. 1.9 per person-year, respectively), there was a significant difference in multiplicity of infection (2.2 vs. 2.6, p\,=\,0.008) and, more strikingly, a higher proportion of highly related infections within households (6.3\,\% vs. 0.9\,\%, p\,=\,0.0005) at higher elevation compared to lower elevation. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic data from a relatively small number of diverse, multiallelic loci reflected fine scale patterns of malaria transmission. Given the increasing interest in applying genetic data to augment malaria surveillance, this study provides evidence that genetic data can be used to inform transmission patterns at local spatial scales even in moderate transmission areas.},

Samples are amplicon sequenced targeting 165 microhaplotypes and 15 drug resistance genes. Metrics of genetic diversity and relatedness, as well as the prevalence of drug resistance markers, are consistent between the two populations. In an area targeted for elimination, intra-host genetic diversity declines in both populations (p\,=\,0.002-0.007), while for the ANC population, population genetic diversity is also lower (p\,=\,0.0004), and genetic relatedness between infections is higher (p\,=\,0.002) than control areas, indicating a recent reduction in the parasite population size.

Multiple important questions pertaining to the design of such studies remain unanswered, limiting efforts to operationalize genomic surveillance tools for routine public health use. This report examines the use of population-level summaries of genetic divergence (FST) and relatedness (identity-by-descent) to distinguish levels of gene flow between malaria populations, focused on field-relevant questions about data size, sampling, and interpretability of observations from genomic surveillance studies. To do this, we use P. falciparum whole genome sequence data and simulated sequence data approximating malaria populations evolving under different current and historical epidemiological conditions. We employ mobile-phone associated mobility data to estimate parasite migration rates over different spatial scales and use this to inform our analysis. This analysis underscores the complementary nature of divergence- and relatedness-based metrics for distinguishing gene flow over different temporal and spatial scales and characterizes the data requirements for using these metrics in different contexts. Our results have implications for the design and implementation of malaria genomic surveillance studies.},

  abstract = {Spatial nonstationarity is a condition in which a simple “global” model cannot explain the relationships between some sets of variables. The nature of the model must alter over space to reflect the structure within the data. In this paper, a technique is developed, termed geographically weighted regression, which attempts to capture this variation by calibrating a multiple regression model which allows different relationships to exist at different points in space. This technique is loosely based on kernel regression. The method itself is introduced and related issues such as the choice of a spatial weighting function are discussed. Following this, a series of related statistical tests are considered which can be described generally as tests for spatial nonstationarity. Using Monte Carlo methods, techniques are proposed for investigating the null hypothesis that the data may be described by a global model rather than a non-stationary one and also for testing whether individual regression coefficients are stable over geographic space. These techniques are demonstrated on a data set from the 1991 U.K. census relating car ownership rates to social class and male unemployment. The paper concludes by discussing ways in which the technique can be extended.},

Asymptomatic individuals can unknowingly carry parasites to regions where mosquito vectors are available, for example, undermining control programs and contributing to transmission when they travel. Understanding how parasites are imported between regions in this way is therefore an important goal for elimination planning and the control of transmission, and would enable control programs to target the principal sources of malaria. Measuring human mobility has traditionally been difficult to do on a population scale, but the widespread adoption of mobile phones in low-income settings presents a unique opportunity to directly measure human movements that are relevant to the spread of malaria. Here, we discuss the opportunities for measuring human mobility using data from mobile phones, as well as some of the issues associated with combining mobility estimates with malaria infection risk maps to meaningfully estimate routes of parasite importation.},

Here we demonstrate the potential to track smallholder maize yield variation in western Kenya, using a combination of 1-m Terra Bella imagery and intensive field sampling on thousands of fields over 2 y. We find that agreement between satellite-based and traditional field survey-based yield estimates depends significantly on the quality of the field-based measures, with agreement highest (R2R2{$<$}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{$><$}mml:msup{$><$}mml:mi mathvariant="normal"{$>$}R{$<$}/mml:mi{$><$}mml:mn{$>$}2{$<$}/mml:mn{$><$}/mml:msup{$><$}/mml:math{$>$} up to 0.4) when using precise field measures of plot area and when using larger fields for which rounding errors are smaller. We further show that satellite-based measures are able to detect positive yield responses to fertilizer and hybrid seed inputs and that the inferred responses are statistically indistinguishable from estimates based on survey-based yields. These results suggest that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used to make predictions of smallholder agricultural productivity that are roughly as accurate as the survey-based measures traditionally used in research and policy applications, and they indicate a substantial near-term potential to quickly generate useful datasets on productivity in smallholder systems, even with minimal or no field training data. Such datasets could rapidly accelerate learning about which interventions in smallholder systems have the most positive impact, thus enabling more rapid transformation of rural livelihoods.},

  abstract = {This study reports results of a classification tree approach to mapping the wetlands of the Congo Basin, focusing on the Cuvette Centrale of the Congo River watershed, an area of 1,176,000~km2. Regional expert knowledge was used to train passive optical remotely sensed imagery of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors, JERS-1 active radar L-band imagery, and topographical indices derived from 3~arc sec elevation data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). All data inputs were resampled to a common 57~m resolution grid. A classification tree bagging procedure was employed to produce a final map of per-grid cell wetland probability. Thirty bagged trees were ranked and the median result was selected to produce the final wetland probability map. Thresholding the probability map at {$<$} 0.5 yielded a proportion of wetland cover for the study area of 32\%, equivalent to 360,000~km2. Wetlands predominate in the CARPE Lake Tele-Lake Tumba landscape located in the western part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the south-eastern Republic of Congo, where they constitute 56\% of the landscape. Local topography depicting relative elevation for sub-catchments proved to be the most valuable discriminator of wetland cover. However, all sources of information (i.e. optical, radar and topography) featured prominently in contributing to the classification tree procedure, reinforcing the idea that multi-source data are useful in the characterization of wetland land cover. The method employed freely available data and a fully automated process, except for training data collection.

  abstract = {Vector-borne diseases continue to contribute significantly to the global burden of disease, and cause epidemics that disrupt health security and cause wider socioeconomic impacts around the world. All are sensitive in different ways to weather and climate conditions, so that the ongoing trends of increasing temperature and more variable weather threaten to undermine recent global progress against these diseases. Here, we review the current state of the global public health effort to address this challenge, and outline related initiatives by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners. Much of the debate to date has centred on attribution of past changes in disease rates to climate change, and the use of scenario-based models to project future changes in risk for specific diseases. While these can give useful indications, the unavoidable uncertainty in such analyses, and contingency on other socioeconomic and public health determinants in the past or future, limit their utility as decision-support tools. For operational health agencies, the most pressing need is the strengthening of current disease control efforts to bring down current disease rates and manage short-term climate risks, which will, in turn, increase resilience to long-term climate change. The WHO and partner agencies are working through a range of programmes to (i) ensure political support and financial investment in preventive and curative interventions to bring down current disease burdens; (ii) promote a comprehensive approach to climate risk management; (iii) support applied research, through definition of global and regional research agendas, and targeted research initiatives on priority diseases and population groups.},

  abstract = {Genotyping-in-Thousands by sequencing (GT-seq) is a method that uses next-generation sequencing of multiplexed PCR products to generate genotypes from relatively small panels (50–500) of targeted single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for thousands of individuals in a single Illumina HiSeq lane. This method uses only unlabelled oligos and PCR master mix in two thermal cycling steps for amplification of targeted SNP loci. During this process, sequencing adapters and dual barcode sequence tags are incorporated into the amplicons enabling thousands of individuals to be pooled into a single sequencing library. Post sequencing, reads from individual samples are split into individual files using their unique combination of barcode sequences. Genotyping is performed with a simple perl script which counts amplicon-specific sequences for each allele, and allele ratios are used to determine the genotypes. We demonstrate this technique by genotyping 2068 individual steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) samples with a set of 192 SNP markers in a single library sequenced in a single Illumina HiSeq lane. Genotype data were 99.9\% concordant to previously collected TaqMan™ genotypes at the same 192 loci, but call rates were slightly lower with GT-seq (96.4\%) relative to Taqman (99.0\%). Of the 192 SNPs, 187 were genotyped in ≥90\% of the individual samples and only 3 SNPs were genotyped in {$<$}70\% of samples. This study demonstrates amplicon sequencing with GT-seq greatly reduces the cost of genotyping hundreds of targeted SNPs relative to existing methods by utilizing a simple library preparation method and massive efficiency of scale.},

The ability to identify the geographic origin and trace the migratory patterns of parasites with clinically important phenotypes such as drug resistance is particularly relevant. With increasing single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery from ongoing Plasmodium genome sequencing projects, a demand for high SNP and sample throughput genotyping platforms for large-scale population genetic studies is required. Low parasitaemias and multiple clone infections present a number of challenges to genotyping P. falciparum. We addressed some of these issues using a custom 384-SNP Illumina GoldenGate assay on P. falciparum DNA from laboratory clones (long-term cultured adapted parasite clones), short-term cultured parasite isolates and clinical (non-cultured isolates) samples from East and West Africa, Southeast Asia and Oceania. Eighty percent of the SNPs (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}306) produced reliable genotype calls on samples containing as little as 2 ng of total genomic DNA and on whole genome amplified DNA. Analysis of artificial mixtures of laboratory clones demonstrated high genotype calling specificity and moderate sensitivity to call minor frequency alleles. Clear resolution of geographically distinct populations was demonstrated using Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and global patterns of population genetic diversity were consistent with previous reports. These results validate the utility of the platform in performing population genetic studies of P. falciparum.},

Here we introduce the related but different concept of measurably recombining malaria parasites to promote convergence around a unifying theoretical framework for malaria genomic epidemiology.

  abstract = {Malaria is still the major parasitic disease in the world, with approximately 438,000 deaths in 2015. Environmental risk factors (ERF) have been widely studied, however, there are discrepancies in the results about their influence on malaria transmission. Recently, papers have been published about geospatial analysis of ERF of malaria to explain why malaria varies from place to place. Our primary objective was to identify the environmental variables most used in the geospatial analysis of malaria transmission. The secondary objective was to identify the geo-analytic methods and techniques, as well as geo-analytic statistics commonly related to ERF and malaria. We conducted a systematized review of articles published from January 2004 to March 2015, within Web of Science, Pubmed and LILACS databases. Initially 676 articles were found, after inclusion and exclusion criteria, 29 manuscripts were selected. Temperature, land use and land cover, surface moisture and vector breeding site were the most frequent included variables. As for geo-analytic methods, geostatistical models with Bayesian framework were the most applied. Kriging interpolations, Geographical Weighted Regression as well as Kulldorff’s spatial scan were the techniques more widely used. The main objective of many of these studies was to use these methods and techniques to create malaria risk maps. Spatial analysis performed with satellite images and georeferenced data are increasing in relevance due to the use of remote sensing and Geographic Information System. The combination of these new technologies identifies ERF more accurately, and the use of Bayesian geostatistical models allows a wide diffusion of malaria risk maps. It is known that temperature, humidity vegetation and vector breeding site play a critical role in malaria transmission; however, other environmental risk factors have also been identified. Risk maps have a tremendous potential to enhance the effectiveness of malaria-control programs.},

  abstract = {Objective Climate change is expected to cause extensive shifts in the epidemiology of infectious and vector-borne diseases. Scenarios on the effects of climate change typically attribute altered distribution of communicable diseases to a rise in average temperature and altered incidence of infectious diseases to weather extremes. Methods Recent evaluations of the effects of climate change on Hawaii have not explored this link. It may be expected that Hawaii’s natural geography and robust water, sanitation, and health care infrastructure renders residents less vulnerable to many threats that are the focus on smaller, lesser developed, and more vulnerable Pacific islands. In addition, Hawaii’s communicable disease surveillance and response system can act rapidly to counter increases in any disease above baseline and to redirect resources to deal with changes, particularly outbreaks due to exotic pathogens. Results The evidence base examined in this article consistently revealed very low climate sensitivity with respect to infectious and mosquito-borne diseases. Conclusions A community resilience model is recommended to increase adaptive capacity for all possible climate change impacts rather an approach that focuses specifically on communicable diseases.

  abstract = {Residual malaria transmission is the actual maintained inoculation of Plasmodium, in spite of a well-designed and implemented vector control programs, and is of great concern for malaria elimination. Residual malaria transmission occurs under several possible circumstances, among which the presence of exophilic vector species, such as Anopheles dirus, or indoor- and outdoor-biting vectors, such as Anopheles nili, or specific behavior, such as feeding on humans indoors, then resting or leaving the house the same night (such as Anopheles moucheti) or also changes in behavior induced by insecticides applied inside houses, such as the well-known deterrent effect of permethrin-treated nets or the irritant effect of DDT. The use of insecticides may change the composition of local Anopheles populations, such as A. arabiensis taking up the place of A. gambiae in Senegal, A. aquasalis replacing A. darlingi in Guyana, or A. harrisoni superseding A. minimus in Vietnam. The change in behavior, such as biting activity earlier than usually reported-for example, Anopheles funestus after a large-scale distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets-or insecticide resistance, in particular the current spread of pyrethroid resistance, could hamper the efficacy of classic pyrethroid-treated long-lasting insecticidal nets and maintained transmission. These issues must be well documented in every situation to elaborate, implement, monitor, and evaluate tailored vector control programs, keeping in mind that they must be conceived as integrated programs with several well and appropriately coordinated approaches, combining entomological but also parasitological, clinical, and social methods and analyses. A successful integrated vector control program must then be designed to reduce transmission and incidence rates of malaria morbidity and overall mortality.},

  abstract = {Understanding how malaria parasites move between populations is important, particularly given the potential for malaria to be reintroduced into areas where it was previously eliminated. We examine the distribution of malaria genetics across seven sites within the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and two nearby countries, Ghana and Kenya, in order to understand how the relatedness of malaria parasites varies across space, and whether there are barriers to the flow of malaria parasites within the DRC or across borders. Parasite DNA was retrieved from dried blood spots from 7 Demographic and Health Survey sample clusters in the DRC. Malaria genetic characteristics of parasites from Ghana and Kenya were also obtained. For each of 9 geographic sites (7 DRC, 1 Ghana and 1 Kenya), a pair-wise RST statistic was calculated, indicating the genetic distance between malaria parasites found in those locations. Mapping genetics across the spatial extent of the study area indicates a complex genetic landscape, where relatedness between two proximal sites may be relatively high (RST~{$>~$}0.64) or low (RST~{$<~$}0.05), and where distal sites also exhibit both high and low genetic similarity. Mantel's tests suggest that malaria genetics differ as geographic distances increase. Principal Coordinate Analysis suggests that genetically related samples are not co-located. Barrier analysis reveals no significant barriers to gene flow between locations. Malaria genetics in the DRC have a complex and fragmented landscape. Limited exchange of genes across space is reflected in greater genetic distance between malaria parasites isolated at greater geographic distances. There is, however, evidence for close genetic ties between distally located sample locations, indicating that movement of malaria parasites and flow of genes is being driven by factors other than distance decay. This research demonstrates the contributions that spatial disease ecology and landscape genetics can make to understanding the evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases.},

We examined the potential for spatial clustering of swine CAFOs in certain parts of the state and used spatial regression techniques to determine the relationships of high swine concentrations to these EJ variables. We found that while swine CAFOs do cluster in certain regions and watersheds of Iowa, these high densities of swine are not associated with traditional EJ populations of low income and minority race/ethnicity. Instead, the potential for environmental injustice in the negative impacts of intensive swine production require a more complex appraisal. The clustering of swine production in watersheds, the presence of antibiotics used in swine production in public waterways, the clustering of manure spills, and other findings suggest that a more literal and figurative "downstream" approach is necessary. We document the presence and location of antibiotics used in animal production in the public waterways of the state. At the same time, we suggest a more "upstream" understanding of the structural, political and economic factors that create an environmentally unjust landscape of swine production in Iowa and the Upper Midwest is also crucial. Finally, we highlight the important role of publicly accessible and high quality data in the analysis of these upstream and downstream EJ questions.},

  abstract = {Accurate depiction of the land and water is critical for the production of land surface parameters from remote sensing data products. Certain parameters, including the land surface temperature, active fires and surface reflectance, can be processed differently when the underlying surface is water as compared with land. Substantial errors in the underlying water mask can then pervade into these products and any products created from them. Historically many global databases have been created to depict global surface water. These databases still fall short of the current needs of the terrestrial remote sensing community working at 250 m spatial resolution. The most recent attempt to address the problem uses the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data set to create the SRTM Water Body Data set (SWBD 2005). The SWBD represents a good first step but still requires additional work to expand the spatial coverage to include the whole globe and to address some erroneous discontinuities in major river networks. To address this issue a new water mask product has been created using the SWBD in combination with MODIS 250 m data to create a complete global map of surface water at 250 m spatial resolution. This effort is automated and intended to produce a dataset for use in processing of raster data (MODIS and future instruments) and for masking out water in final terrestrial raster data products. This new global dataset is produced from remotely sensed data and provided to the public in digital format, free of charge. The data set can be found on the Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) website at http://landcover.org. This dataset is expected to be a base set of information to describe the surface of Earth as either land or water which is a fundamental distinction upon which other descriptions can be made.},

As malaria elimination/eradication takes a prominent place in the health agenda, an integrated action, addressing all elements of the malaria system, which contributes to improved knowledge and to building local capacity and that brings about positive effects to the health of the local population has the greatest chance to produce fast, effective, and sustainable results.},

  abstract = {The Sahel/Savannah belt of Africa is a contact zone between two subsistence systems (nomadic pastoralism and sedentary farming) and of two groups of populations, namely Eurasians penetrating from northern Africa southwards and sub-Saharan Africans migrating northwards. Because pastoralism is characterized by a high degree of mobility, it leaves few significant archaeological traces. Demographic history seen through the lens of population genetic studies complements our historical and archaeological knowledge in this African region. In this review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of demographic history in the Sahel/Savannah belt as revealed by genetic studies. We show the impact of food-producing subsistence strategies on population structure and the somewhat different migration patterns in the western and eastern part of the region. Genomic studies show that the gene pool of various groups of Sahelians consists in a complex mosaic of several ancestries. We also touch upon various signals of genetic adaptations such as lactase persistence, taste sensitivity and malaria resistance, all of which have different distribution patterns among Sahelian populations. Overall, genetic studies contribute to gain a deeper understanding about the demographic and adaptive history of human populations in this specific African region and beyond.},

  abstract = {Abstract Developments in digital photogrammetry have provided geomorphologists with an automated tool to generate digital elevation models (DEMs) at exceedingly high densities. Although such software tools are available at low cost and run on far cheaper hardware than previous generations of photogrammetric instrumentation, some expertise is still required to derive accurate data.Various recommendations are provided that should enable the inexperienced user to make effective use of digital photogrammetry. Key issues discussed include the role of photo-control, the significance of checkpoints in the object space, and the importance of camera calibration data. An overview of self-calibration methods is provided, which is valuable in situations when a non-photogrammetric camera has been used. Accurate camera modelling also affects DEM quality and this issue is examined through assessing the impact of DEM inaccuracies upon derived data used for geomorphological enquiry.Although the automated software packages are designed primarily for use with satellite imagery or vertical aerial photography, it is explained how such software can be used for both close range and oblique imagery. The procedure requires rotating the object coordinate system defined by the photo-control points and the mathematics required to achieve this is provided. The procedure is used to derive the morphology of a soil surface using oblique, close-range imagery and demonstrates the effectiveness of this particular approach.

The number of malaria cases in Thailand decreased 90\% between 2012 and 2020, yet elimination has remained a major public health challenge with persistent transmission foci and ongoing importation. There are three main hotspots of malaria transmission in Thailand: Ubon Ratchathani and Sisaket in the Northeast; Tak in the West; and Yala in the South. However, the degree to which these hotspots are connected via travel and importation has not been well characterized. Here, we develop a metapopulation model parameterized by mobile phone call detail record data to estimate parasite flow among these regions. We show that parasite connectivity among these regions was limited, and that each of these provinces independently drove the malaria transmission in nearby provinces. Overall, our results suggest that due to the low probability of domestic importation between the transmission hotspots, control and elimination strategies can be considered separately for each region.},

This proportion is much greater than observed in other organisms. Also unusual is that the site-frequency spectra of synonymous and nonsynonymous polymorphisms are virtually indistinguishable. We hypothesized that the complicated life cycle of malaria parasites might lead to qualitatively different population genetics from that predicted from the classical Wright-Fisher (WF) model, which assumes a single random-mating population with a finite and constant population size in an organism with nonoverlapping generations. This paper summarizes simulation studies of random genetic drift and selection in malaria parasites that take into account their unusual life history. Our results show that random genetic drift in the malaria life cycle is more pronounced than under the WF model. Paradoxically, the efficiency of purifying selection in the malaria life cycle is also greater than under WF, and the relative efficiency of positive selection varies according to conditions. Additionally, the site-frequency spectrum under neutrality is also more skewed toward low-frequency alleles than expected with WF. These results highlight the importance of considering the malaria life cycle when applying existing population genetic tools based on the WF model. The same caveat applies to other species with similarly complex life cycles.},

We developed a genetic mixing index to estimate the likelihood of samples being local or imported from parasite genetic data and inferred the direction and intensity of parasite flow between locations using an epidemiological model integrating the travel survey and mobile phone calling data. Our approach indicates that, contrary to dogma, frequent mixing occurs in low transmission regions in the southwest, and elimination will require interventions in addition to reducing imported infections from forested regions.

  abstract = {As many malaria-endemic countries move towards elimination of Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent human malaria parasite, effective tools for monitoring malaria epidemiology are urgent priorities. P. falciparum population genetic approaches offer promising tools for understanding transmission and spread of the disease, but a high prevalence of multi-clone or polygenomic infections can render estimation of even the most basic parameters, such as allele frequencies, challenging. A previous method, COIL, was developed to estimate complexity of infection (COI) from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, but relies on monogenomic infections to estimate allele frequencies or requires external allele frequency data which may not available. Estimates limited to monogenomic infections may not be representative, however, and when the average COI is high, they can be difficult or impossible to obtain. Therefore, we developed THE REAL McCOIL, Turning HEterozygous SNP data into Robust Estimates of ALelle frequency, via Markov chain Monte Carlo, and Complexity Of Infection using Likelihood, to incorporate polygenomic samples and simultaneously estimate allele frequency and COI. This approach was tested via simulations then applied to SNP data from cross-sectional surveys performed in three Ugandan sites with varying malaria transmission. We show that THE REAL McCOIL consistently outperforms COIL on simulated data, particularly when most infections are polygenomic. Using field data we show that, unlike with COIL, we can distinguish epidemiologically relevant differences in COI between and within these sites. Surprisingly, for example, we estimated high average COI in a peri-urban subregion with lower transmission intensity, suggesting that many of these cases were imported from surrounding regions with higher transmission intensity. THE REAL McCOIL therefore provides a robust tool for understanding the molecular epidemiology of malaria across transmission settings.},

  abstract = {Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number qD, where q = 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number qD, q {$>$} 0) and present a unified approach for both individual-based (abundance) data and sample-based (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers: q = 0 (species richness), q = 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and q = 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants.},

Diagnostic tools with a low limit of detection (LOD) have allowed us to develop a more detailed understanding of asymptomatic malaria and its impact. These highly sensitive diagnostics have demonstrated that the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria is greater than previously thought. In addition, it is now possible to detect the malaria reservoir in the community, something that was previously not feasible. Asymptomatic malaria has previously not been treated, but research has begun to examine whether treating individuals with asymptomatic malaria may lead to health benefits. Finally, we have begun to understand the importance of asymptomatic malaria in ongoing transmission.Expert opinion: Therefore, with malaria elimination back on the agenda, asymptomatic malaria can no longer be ignored, especially in light of new ultra-sensitive diagnostic tools.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}An approach to use the available agricultural parcel information to automatically select training samples for crop classification is investigated. Previous research addressed the multi-evidence crop classification approach using an ensemble classifier. This first produced confidence measures using three Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks trained separately with spectral, texture and vegetation indices; classification labels were then assigned based on Endorsement Theory. The present study proposes an approach to feed this ensemble classifier with automatically selected training samples. The available vector data representing crop boundaries with corresponding crop codes are used as a source for training samples. These vector data are created by farmers to support subsidy claims and are, therefore, prone to errors such as mislabeling of crop codes and boundary digitization errors. The proposed approach is named as ECRA (Ensemble based Cluster Refinement Approach). ECRA first automatically removes mislabeled samples and then selects the refined training samples in an iterative training-reclassification scheme. Mislabel removal is based on the expectation that mislabels in each class will be far from cluster centroid. However, this must be a soft constraint, especially when working with a hypothesis space that does not contain a good approximation of the targets classes. Difficulty in finding a good approximation often exists either due to less informative data or a large hypothesis space. Thus this approach uses the spectral, texture and indices domains in an ensemble framework to iteratively remove the mislabeled pixels from the crop clusters declared by the farmers. Once the clusters are refined, the selected border samples are used for final learning and the unknown samples are classified using the multi-evidence approach. The study is implemented with WorldView-2 multispectral imagery acquired for a study area containing 10 crop classes. The proposed approach is compared with the multi-evidence approach based on training samples selected randomly and border samples based on initial cluster centroids within agricultural parcels without any refinement. The results clarify the improvement in overall classification accuracy to 82.3 \% based on the proposed approach from 74.9 \% based on random selection and 71.4\% on non-refined border samples.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The present study is used to feed this classification approach with automatically selected training samples based on available vector data (agricultural parcels representing crop boundaries with crop codes). The vector data are created by farmers to support subsidy claims and are, therefore, prone to errors such as boundary digitization mismatch and mislabeling of crop codes. The proposed approach, ensemble-based cluster refinement approach (ECRA), refines the declared crop clusters in an iterative training-classification scheme and provides potential training samples that give correct class descriptions. ECRA operates based on two assumptions: 1) mislabels in each class will be far from their cluster centroid and 2) each crop class based on the available vector data has more correctly labeled samples than mislabeled samples. Three datasets, derived from bitemporal WorldView-2 multispectral imagery, are used in an ensemble framework to iteratively refine the samples from crop clusters declared by the farmers: spectral, texture, and vegetation indices. Once the refinement of clusters is complete, final training samples are identified. They are used for learning and the satellite imagery is classified using the multievidence classification approach. The study is implemented with WorldView-2 imagery acquired for a study area in Denmark containing 15 crop classes. The multievidence classification approach with ECRA-based refinement is compared with the classification based on common training sample selection methods (manual and random). It is also compared with the winner-takes-all-based classification approach. ECRA achieves an overall classification accuracy of 92.8\%, which is higher than existing common approaches.},

  abstract = {Despite using multiple input datasets for effective crop classification, it is important to select an appropriate method that efficiently integrates these multiple datasets to produce accurate classification results. In this paper, we present an endorsement theory-based crop classification approach that considers the qualitative information, in terms of prediction probabilities, from different input datasets and integrates them efficiently to produce final classification results. Three different input datasets are used in this study: 1) spectral; 2) texture; and 3) indices from multitemporal (spring, early summer) WorldView-2 multispectral imagery. A multilayer perceptron classifier is trained with the multitemporal datasets separately using a backpropagation learning algorithm, and prediction probabilities are produced for each pixel as evidence against each crop class. An integration rule based on endorsement theory is applied to these multiple evidence by considering their individual contribution, and the most probable class of a pixel is identified. Integration of the three multidate datasets by the proposed method is found to produce higher overall classification accuracy (91.2\%) when compared to conventional winner-takes-all approach (89\%). In order to determine which individual dataset is more useful for crop discrimination, the dataset's performance is compared using evidence and contributions produced in the proposed integration method for four selected crops, for both single- and multidate. The results of this analyses showed that seasonal textures information outperformed both spectral and indices. To verify this finding, results of individual dataset classification are examined. The highest overall classification accuracy of 88.8\% is achieved by the use of multidate texture, where multidate spectral and indices resulted in 86.3\% and 84.4\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Global Land Cover (GLC) information is fundamental for environmental change studies, land resource management, sustainable development, and many other societal benefits. Although GLC data exists at spatial resolutions of 300. m and 1000. m, a 30. m resolution mapping approach is now a feasible option for the next generation of GLC products. Since most significant human impacts on the land system can be captured at this scale, a number of researchers are focusing on such products. This paper reports the operational approach used in such a project, which aims to deliver reliable data products.Over 10,000 Landsat-like satellite images are required to cover the entire Earth at 30. m resolution. To derive a GLC map from such a large volume of data necessitates the development of effective, efficient, economic and operational approaches. Automated approaches usually provide higher efficiency and thus more economic solutions, yet existing automated classification has been deemed ineffective because of the low classification accuracy achievable (typically below 65\%) at global scale at 30. m resolution. As a result, an approach based on the integration of pixel- and object-based methods with knowledge (POK-based) has been developed. To handle the classification process of 10 land cover types, a split-and-merge strategy was employed, i.e. firstly each class identified in a prioritized sequence and then results are merged together. For the identification of each class, a robust integration of pixel-and object-based classification was developed. To improve the quality of the classification results, a knowledge-based interactive verification procedure was developed with the support of web service technology. The performance of the POK-based approach was tested using eight selected areas with differing landscapes from five different continents. An overall classification accuracy of over 80\% was achieved. This indicates that the developed POK-based approach is effective and feasible for operational GLC mapping at 30. m resolution.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The reservoir of Plasmodium infection in humans has traditionally been defined by blood slide positivity. This study was designed to characterize the local reservoir of infection in relation to the diverse var genes that encode the major surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum blood stages and underlie the parasite's ability to establish chronic infection and transmit from human to mosquito. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the molecular epidemiology of the var multigene family at local sites in Gabon, Senegal and Kenya which differ in parasite prevalence and transmission intensity. 1839 distinct var gene types were defined by sequencing DBLα domains in the three sites. Only 76 (4.1\%) var types were found in more than one population indicating spatial heterogeneity in var types across the African continent. The majority of var types appeared only once in the population sample. Non-parametric statistical estimators predict in each population at minimum five to seven thousand distinct var types. Similar diversity of var types was seen in sites with different parasite prevalences. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Var population genomics provides new insights into the epidemiology of P. falciparum in Africa where malaria has never been conquered. In particular, we have described the extensive reservoir of infection in local African sites and discovered a unique var population structure that can facilitate superinfection through minimal overlap in var repertoires among parasite genomes. Our findings show that var typing as a molecular surveillance system defines the extent of genetic complexity in the reservoir of infection to complement measures of malaria prevalence. The observed small scale spatial diversity of var genes suggests that var genetics could greatly inform current malaria mapping approaches and predict complex malaria population dynamics due to the import of var types to areas where no widespread pre-existing immunity in the population exists.},

  abstract = {Mathematical model is a powerful tool to investigate, simulate, and evaluate potential interventions for infectious diseases dynamics. Much effort has focused on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)-type compartment model from hosts’ perspective while pathogens, the actual causes of infectious diseases, are usually modeled implicitly. Nevertheless, pathogen, host, and environment together form an inseparable epidemiological triad. In this study, we propose an innovative and generalizable modeling framework for various types of infectious diseases from pathogen's perspective. This framework builds upon interacting pathogen subpopulations, where host, environment, and vectors are all considered as “patches” for pathogens. It operates as a patch dynamics model from pathogens’ perspective. Each patch, the basic module of this modeling framework, has four standard mechanisms of pathogen population change: birth (replication), death, inflow, and outflow, where inflow and outflow connect different patches. Therefore, it naturally distinguishes between-host transmission process (inflow and outflow) and within-host infection process (replication) during the entire transmission-infection cycle. We demonstrate that SIR-type model is actually a cross-sectional and discretized case of our patch dynamics model in pathogens’ viewpoint. In addition, this modeling framework is also an agent-based model from hosts’ perspective by incorporating individual host’s various traits. We provide an operational standard to formulate this modular-designed patch dynamics model. Model parameterization is feasible with a wide range of sources, including genomics data, surveillance data, electronic health record, and from other novel technologies. We then provide proof-of-concept case studies to tackle some of the existing challenges of SIR-type models in sexually transmitted disease, healthcare acquired infection, vector-borne disease, and multiple-transmission pathways. This modeling framework not only provides theoretical explanations to known phenomena, but also generates novel insights of disease dynamics from a holistic viewpoint. It is able to simulate and handle much more complicated and realistic disease transmission scenarios across biological scales.},

  abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) is the second most commonly grown crop worldwide and number one staple food in Africa where it accounts for more than 50\% of the energy requirements. However, despite its widespread cultivation and the significance of maize information in Africa, maize crop maps and yield forecasts are hardly available. Yet, systematic area, spatial distribution, and maize yield estimates are important in understanding and addressing food security in Africa. Objective monitoring of maize yield statisics in a systematic way is possible with remotely sensed data. However, absence of maize yield forecasts using remote sensing in Africa has been attributed to the cost of acquiring satellite imagery and the heterogeneity of agricultural landscapes. The recent advances in sensors technology and availability of free high-resolution (spatial and temporal) multispectral satellite images afford an opportunity to forecast maize yield as well as mapping its spatial distribution in near real-time basis. This review gives an overview of maize yield estimation using remotely sensed information and its potential application in a fragmented and highly granular agricultural landscapes in Africa, including inherent challenges and research needs. The review was motivated by challenges faced by researchers and national agricultural statistical services agents when forecasting maize yield using conventional ground-based survey methods. These problems include, but are not limited to, restricted accuracy, and cost and time spent resulting in missed opportunities in food security early warning systems and proper developmental interventions. We conclude that by picking multispectral sensors with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, as well as appropriate classification techniques and accurate ground-truthing data, remote sensing can be a practical option for estimating maize grain yield and its spatio-temporal dynamics in heterogeneous African agricultural landscapes for designing appropriate developmental interventions and technological out scaling.},

Throughout summer and fall 2014 and winter 2015, El Niño Watch, issued by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, assessed likely El Niño development during the Northern Hemisphere fall and winter, persisting into spring 2015. METHODS: We identified geographic regions where environmental conditions may increase infectious disease transmission if the predicted El Niño occurs using El Niño indicators (Sea Surface Temperature [SST], Outgoing Longwave Radiation [OLR], and rainfall anomalies) and literature review of El Niño-infectious disease associations. RESULTS: SSTs in the equatorial Pacific and western Indian Oceans were anomalously elevated during August-October 2014, consistent with a developing weak El Niño event. Teleconnections with local climate is evident in global precipitation patterns, with positive OLR anomalies (drier than average conditions) across Indonesia and coastal southeast Asia, and negative anomalies across northern China, the western Indian Ocean, central Asia, north-central and northeast Africa, Mexico/Central America, the southwestern United States, and the northeastern and southwestern tropical Pacific. Persistence of these conditions could produce environmental settings conducive to increased transmission of cholera, dengue, malaria, Rift Valley fever, and other infectious diseases in regional hotspots as during previous El Niño events. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The current development of weak El Niño conditions may have significant potential implications for global public health in winter 2014-spring 2015. Enhanced surveillance and other preparedness measures in predicted infectious disease hotspots could mitigate health impacts.},

By projecting maps to a new geographic reference framework and scaling pixel values to a new size, distortions of map information are introduced that can affect the proportion and arrangement of thematic classes across the landscape. Using a sample land cover dataset depicting a heterogeneous landscape, this paper examines these impacts using three common raster-based transformation methods and introduces a new vector-based method that minimizes error propagation. While relative class area was best preserved by a nearest-neighbor resampling method, distortions to the contiguity of thematic classes and the overall fragmentation of the landscape were minimized when using the vector-based projection and resampling method. Results demonstrate that more than a third of pixel values of a categorical map may be affected by common projection and scaling methods and reinforce the need for careful attention to impacts of error propagation in categorical data transformations.},

SaTScan methodology was used by the malaria control programme to detect local malaria clusters to assist disease control planning. The third season for case cluster identification overlapped with the first season of implementing an outbreak identification and response system in the area. METHODS: SaTScan software using the Kulldorf method of retrospective space-time permutation and the Bernoulli purely spatial model was used to identify malaria clusters using definitively confirmed individual cases in seven towns over three malaria seasons. Following passive case reporting at health facilities during the 2002 to 2005 seasons, active case detection was carried out in the communities, this assisted with determining the probable source of infection. The distribution and statistical significance of the clusters were explored by means of Monte Carlo replication of data sets under the null hypothesis with replications greater than 999 to ensure adequate power for defining clusters. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: SaTScan detected five space-clusters and two space-time clusters during the study period. There was strong concordance between recognized local clustering of cases and outbreak declaration in specific towns. Both Albertsnek and Thambokulu reported malaria outbreaks in the same season as space-time clusters. This synergy may allow mutual validation of the two systems in confirming outbreaks demanding additional resources and cluster identification at local level to better target resources. CONCLUSION: Exploring the clustering of cases assisted with the planning of public health activities, including mobilizing health workers and resources. Where appropriate additional indoor residual spraying, focal larviciding and health promotion activities, were all also carried out.},

In the 1-m spatial resolution images acquired by the IKONOS satellite, details of buildings, individual trees, and vegetation structural variations are detectable. The visibility of such details opens up many new applications, which require the use of geometrical information contained in the images. This paper presents an application in which spectral and textural information is used for mapping the leaf area index (LAI) of different vegetation types. This study includes the estimation of LAI by different spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) combined with image textural information and geostatistical parameters derived from high resolution satellite data. It is shown that the relationships between spectral vegetation indices and biophysical parameters should be developed separately for each vegetation type, and that the combination of the texture indices and vegetation indices results in an improved fit of the regression equation for most vegetation types when compared with one derived from SVIs alone. High within-field spatial variability was found in LAI, suggesting that high resolution mapping of LAI may be relevant to the introduction of precision farming techniques in the agricultural management strategies of the investigated area. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Thus, the original Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) specifying stormwater management was slanted towards flood control. Much experience has been gained in years since Maryland implemented the original program. Recently, additional emphasis has been directed on controlling the quality of runoff from land use changed by urbanization and the quantity of this runoff to reduce stream channel erosion. Recognizing that the State’s stormwater management program had not changed in over a decade, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) proposed modifications to the COMAR in July 2000. The primary goals of the proposed regulations were to refocus the overall objectives for controlling runoff from new development and promote environmentally sustainable techniques. To that end, MDE developed the 2000 Maryland Stormwater Design Manual, Volumes I \& II (MDE, 2000) to establish stormwater design criteria and provide specific procedures for local jurisdictional use in improving existing programs for nonpoint source pollution control within the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries as well as coastal bays. As such, the Design Manual would serve as the primary source of stormwater management information for the development community and regulatory agencies throughout the State. In the beginning, MDE developed the Design Manual to address three goals to: (1) protect the waters of the State from the adverse impacts urban stormwater, (2) provide design guidance on effective structural and nonstructural best management practices (BMPs) for new development sites, and (3) improve the quality of BMPs that are constructed in the State. While drafting the Design Manual, MDE recognized that the project was evolving into a more comprehensive approach to stormwater design. Included in this approach was better guidance for total site design and incentives for environmentally sustainable or “green” development techniques. The projected outcome of this new approach would be site designs that more closely mimic natural processes and reduce reliance on the use of structural management techniques to treat stormwater runoff. As a final product, the Design Manual shows great promise in accomplishing the goals and objectives established in the beginning and during this project. The adopted manual serves as a primary source of stormwater design information for the development community and regulatory agencies in both Maryland and in many other areas.},

  abstract = {Recently launched and upcoming satellite systems are expected to make crop mapping increasingly accurate and operational. This study aims at an evaluation of the optimum number of acquisition dates and most suitable temporal windows for the discrimination of crops over heterogeneous agricultural landscapes utilizing multitemporal data from the RapidEye satellite constellation. For a case study site in West-Uzbekistan, which covers 230,000. ha of irrigated land, nine 6.5. m RapidEye mosaics were obtained throughout the vegetation period of 2009. The acquisition window of one mosaic was maximum five days. The optimum number of acquisition dates and acquisition windows relevant for accurate crop identification was assessed by applying a random forest algorithm to all possible combinations of the available RapidEye mosaics. Overall accuracy increased with the number of acquisition dates selected for the classification. Classifying all nine mosaics resulted in an overall accuracy of 85.7\%. This accuracy level could be already achieved by using five or more acquisitions during distinctive phases of the vegetation period, among others short before winter-wheat harvest and in initial growing phases of summer crops. It could be shown that accurate early season crop maps at field level can be derived enabling water managers to update water distribution schedules in the study region. All 53,302 fields of the irrigation system including very small parcels with a size of 0.05. ha could be classified due to the high geometric resolution of RapidEye. Detailed NDVI temporal profiles demonstrated the potential of RapidEye for including minor crops into classifications of heterogeneous agricultural areas. Class-wise accuracy pointed to the challenge of classifying sub-tree cultivation and indicated that classification of minor crops could also depend on the spatial resolution of satellite images. The case study suggests identifying temporal windows for crop mapping serving as substantial support for land and water management in different agro-environmental settings. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

With approximately 170 CubeSats orbiting at full operational capacity, the Planet CubeSat constellation currently offers an average revisit time of \&lt;1 day for the Arctic and near-daily revisit time globally at 3 m spatial resolution. Such data have numerous potential applications for water resource monitoring, hydrologic modeling and hydrologic research. Here we evaluate Planet CubeSat imaging capabilities and potential scientific utility for surface water studies in the Yukon Flats, a large sub-Arctic wetland in north central Alaska. We find that surface water areas delineated from Planet imagery have a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of \&lt;11\% and geolocation accuracy of \&lt;10 m as compared with manual delineations from high resolution (0.3–0.5 m) WorldView-2/3 panchromatic satellite imagery. For a 625 km2 subarea of the Yukon Flats, our time series analysis reveals that roughly one quarter of 268 lakes analyzed responded to changes in Yukon River discharge over the period 23 June–1 October 2016, one half steadily contracted, and one quarter remained unchanged. The spatial pattern of observed lake changes is heterogeneous. While connections to Yukon River control the hydrologically connected lakes, the behavior of other lakes is complex, likely driven by a combination of intricate flow paths, underlying geology and permafrost. Limitations of Planet CubeSat imagery include a lack of an automated cloud mask, geolocation inaccuracies, and inconsistent radiometric calibration across multiple platforms. Although these challenges must be addressed before Planet CubeSat imagery can achieve its full potential for large-scale hydrologic research, we conclude that CubeSat imagery offers a powerful new tool for the study and monitoring of dynamic surface water bodies.},

For example, many empirical studies have produced the disturbing finding that diseases continue to persist in modern city centers with zero or low rates of transmission. We develop spatial models of vector-borne disease dynamics on a network of patches to examine how the movement of humans in heterogeneous environments affects transmission. We show that the movement of humans between patches is sufficient to maintain disease persistence in patches with zero transmission. We construct two classes of models using different approaches: (i) Lagrangian models that mimic human commuting behavior and (ii) Eulerian models that mimic human migration. We determine the basic reproduction number R0 for both modeling approaches. We show that for both approaches that if the disease-free equilibrium is stable (R0{$<$}1) then it is globally stable and if the disease-free equilibrium is unstable (R0{$>$}1) then there exists a unique positive (endemic) equilibrium that is globally stable among positive solutions. Finally, we prove in general that Lagrangian and Eulerian modeling approaches are not equivalent. The modeling approaches presented provide a framework to explore spatial vector-borne disease dynamics and control in heterogeneous environments. As an example, we consider two patches in which the disease dies out in both patches when there is no movement between them. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the disease becomes endemic in both patches when humans move between the two patches.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the relationship between resolution and predictability and found that while increasing resolution provides more descriptive information about the patterns in data, it also increases the difficulty of accurately modeling those patterns. There are limits to the predictability of natural phenomenon at particular resolu-tions, and "fractal-like" rules determine how both "data" and "model" predictability change with reso-lution. We analyzed land use data by resampling map data sets at several different spatial resolutions and measur-ing predictability at each. Spatial auto-predictability (Pa) is the reduction in uncertainty about the state of a pixel in a scene given knowledge of the state of adjacent pixels in that scene, and spatial cross-predictability (Pc) is the reduction in uncertainty about the state of a pixel in a scene given knowledge of the state of cor-responding pixels in other scenes. Pa is a measure of the internal pattern in the data while Pc is a measure of the ability of some other "model" to represent that pattern. We found a strong linear relationship between the log of Pa and the log of resolution (measured as the number of pixels per square kilometer). This fractal-like characteristic of "self-similarity" with decreasing resolution implies that predictability may be best described using a unitless dimension that summarizes how it changes with resolution. While Pa generally increases with increasing resolution (because more informa-tion is being included), Pc generally falls or remains stable (because it is easier to model aggregate results than fine grain ones). Thus one can define an "optimal" resolution for a particular modeling problem that balances the benefit in terms of increasing data predictability (Pa) as one increases resolution, with the cost of decreasing model predictability (Pc)"},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax poses a significant challenge to malaria elimination due to its ability to cause relapsed infections from reactivation of dormant liver parasites called hypnozoites. We analyzed 69 P. vivax whole genome sequences obtained from subjects residing in three different villages along the Peruvian Amazon. This included 23 paired P. vivax samples from subjects who experienced recurrent P. vivax parasitemia following observed treatment with chloroquine and primaquine. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples collected from subjects. P. vivax DNA was enriched using selective whole genome amplification and whole genome sequencing. We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the core P. vivax genome to determine characteristics of the parasite population using discriminant analysis of principal components, maximum likelihood estimation of individual ancestries, and phylogenetic analysis. We estimated the relatedness of the paired samples by calculating the number of segregating sites and using a hidden Markov model approach to estimate identity by descent. RESULTS: We present a comprehensive dataset of population genetics of Plasmodium vivax in the Peruvian Amazonian. We define the parasite population structure in this region and demonstrate a novel method for distinguishing homologous relapses from reinfections or heterologous relapses with improved accuracy. The parasite population in this area was quite diverse with an estimated five subpopulations and evidence of a highly heterogeneous ancestry of some of the isolates, similar to previous analyses of P. vivax in this region. Pairwise comparison of recurrent infections determined that there were 12 homologous relapses and 3 likely heterologous relapses with highly related parasites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to evaluate recurrent P. vivax infections using whole genome sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Whole genome sequencing is a high-resolution tool that can identify P. vivax homologous relapses with increased sensitivity, while also providing data about drug resistance and parasite population genetics. This information is important for evaluating the efficacy of known and novel antirelapse medications in endemic areas and thus advancing the campaign to eliminate malaria.},

  abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of microbial pathogens from clinical samples is a highly sensitive tool used to gain a deeper understanding of the biology, epidemiology, and drug resistance mechanisms of many infections. However, WGS of organisms which exhibit low densities in their hosts is challenging due to high levels of host genomic DNA (gDNA), which leads to very low coverage of the microbial genome. WGS of Plasmodium vivax, the most widely distributed form of malaria, is especially difficult because of low parasite densities and the lack of an ex vivo culture system. Current techniques used to enrich P.~vivax DNA from clinical samples require significant resources or are not consistently effective. Here, we demonstrate that selective whole-genome amplification (SWGA) can enrich P.~vivax gDNA from unprocessed human blood samples and dried blood spots for high-quality WGS, allowing genetic characterization of isolates that would otherwise have been prohibitively expensive or impossible to sequence. We achieved an average genome coverage of 24×, with up to 95\% of the P.~vivax core genome covered by ≥5 reads. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) characteristics and drug resistance mutations seen were consistent with those of other P.~vivax sequences from a similar region in Peru, demonstrating that SWGA produces high-quality sequences for downstream analysis. SWGA is a robust tool that will enable efficient, cost-effective WGS of P.~vivax isolates from clinical samples that can be applied to other neglected microbial pathogens. IMPORTANCE: Malaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites that caused 214 million symptomatic cases and 438,000 deaths in 2015. Plasmodium vivax is the most widely distributed species, causing the majority of malaria infections outside sub-Saharan Africa. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of Plasmodium parasites from clinical samples has revealed important insights into the epidemiology and mechanisms of drug resistance of malaria. However, WGS of P.~vivax is challenging due to low parasite levels in humans and the lack of a routine system to culture the parasites. Selective whole-genome amplification (SWGA) preferentially amplifies the genomes of pathogens from mixtures of target and host gDNA. Here, we demonstrate that SWGA is a simple, robust method that can be used to enrich P.~vivax genomic DNA (gDNA) from unprocessed human blood samples and dried blood spots for cost-effective, high-quality WGS.},

  abstract = {In the course of malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), malaria epidemiology has experienced drastic spatiotemporal changes with residual transmission concentrated along international borders and the rising predominance of Plasmodium vivax. The emergence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites resistant to artemisinin and partner drugs renders artemisinin-based combination therapies less effective while the potential spread of multidrug-resistant parasites elicits concern. Vector behavioral changes and insecticide resistance have reduced the effectiveness of core vector control measures. In recognition of these problems, the Southeast Asian International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) has been conducting multidisciplinary research to determine how human migration, antimalarial drug resistance, vector behavior, and insecticide resistance sustain malaria transmission at international borders. These efforts allow us to comprehensively understand the ecology of border malaria transmission and develop population genomics tools to identify and track parasite introduction. In addition to employing in~vivo, in~vitro, and molecular approaches to monitor the emergence and spread of drug-resistant parasites, we also use genomic and genetic methods to reveal novel mechanisms of antimalarial drug resistance of parasites. We also use omics and population genetics approaches to study insecticide resistance in malaria vectors and identify changes in mosquito community structure, vectorial potential, and seasonal dynamics. Collectively, the scientific findings from the ICEMR research activities offer a systematic view of the factors sustaining residual malaria transmission and identify potential solutions to these problems to accelerate malaria elimination in the GMS.},

  abstract = {The predominant analytical approach to associate landscape patterns with gene flow processes is based on the association of cost distances with genetic distances between individuals. Mantel and partial Mantel tests have been the dominant statistical tools used to correlate cost distances and genetic distances in landscape genetics. However, the inherent high correlation among alternative resistance models results in a high risk of spurious correlations using simple Mantel tests. Several refinements, including causal modeling, have been developed to reduce the risk of affirming spurious correlations and to assist model selection. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been incomplete in several respects. To demonstrate the general reliability of the causal modeling approach with Mantel tests, it must be shown to be able to correctly identify a wide range of landscape resistance models as the correct drivers relative to alternative hypotheses. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of the originally published causal modeling framework to support the correct model and reject alternative hypotheses of isolation by distance and isolation by barriers and to (2) evaluate the effectiveness of causal modeling involving direct competition of all hypotheses to support the correct model and reject all alternative landscape resistance models. We found that partial Mantel tests have very low Type II error rates, but elevated Type I error rates. This leads to frequent identification of support for spurious correlations between alternative resistance hypotheses and genetic distance, independent of the true resistance model. The frequency in which this occurs is directly related to the degree of correlation between true and alternative resistance models. We propose an improvement based on the relative support of the causal modeling diagnostic tests.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: While traditional epidemiological approaches have supported significant reductions in malaria incidence across many countries, higher resolution information about local and regional malaria epidemiology will be needed to efficiently target interventions for elimination. The application of genetic epidemiological methods for the analysis of parasite genetics has, thus far, primarily been confined to research settings. To illustrate how these technical methods can be used to advance programmatic and operational needs of National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs), and accelerate global progress to eradication, this manuscript presents seven use cases for which genetic epidemiology approaches to parasite genetic data are informative to the decision-making of NMCPs. METHODS: The use cases were developed through a highly iterative process that included an extensive review of the literature and global guidance documents, including the 2017 World Health Organization's Framework for Malaria Elimination, and collection of stakeholder input. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with programmatic and technical experts about the needs and opportunities for genetic epidemiology methods in malaria elimination. RESULTS: Seven use cases were developed: Detect resistance, Assess drug resistance gene flow, Assess transmission intensity, Identify foci, Determine connectivity of parasite populations, Identify imported cases, and Characterize local transmission chains. The method currently used to provide the information sought, population unit for implementation, the pre-conditions for using these approaches, and post-conditions intended as a product of the use case were identified for each use case. DISCUSSION: This framework of use cases will prioritize research and development of genetic epidemiology methods that best achieve the goals of NMCPs, and ultimately, inform the establishment of normative policy guidance for their uses. With significant engagement of stakeholders from malaria endemic countries and collaboration with local programme experts to ensure strategic implementation, genetic epidemiological approaches have tremendous potential to accelerate global malaria elimination efforts.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: The variant call format (VCF) is a generic format for storing DNA polymorphism data such as SNPs, insertions, deletions and structural variants, together with rich annotations. VCF is usually stored in a compressed manner and can be indexed for fast data retrieval of variants from a range of positions on the reference genome. The format was developed for the 1000 Genomes Project, and has also been adopted by other projects such as UK10K, dbSNP and the NHLBI Exome Project. VCFtools is a software suite that implements various utilities for processing VCF files, including validation, merging, comparing and also provides a general Perl API.

  abstract = {While the impacts of climate change on individual species and communities have been well documented there is little evidence on climate-mediated changes for entire ecosystems. Pristine alpine environments can provide unique insights into natural, physical and ecologi- cal response to climate change yet broad scale and long-term studies on these potential ‘ecosystem sentinels’ are scarce.Weaddressed this issue by examining cover changes of 1689 high-elevation wetlands (temporarily or perennial water-saturated grounds) in the Bolivian Cordillera Real, a region that has experienced significant warming and glacier melt- ing over the last 30 years.Wecombined high spatial resolution satellite images from PLEIA- DES with the long-term images archive from LANDSAT to 1) examine environmental factors (e.g., glacier cover, wetland and watershed size) that affected wetland cover changes, and 2) identify wetlands’ features that affect their vulnerability (using habitat drying as a proxy) in the face of climate change. Over the (1984–2011) period, our data showed an increasing trend in the mean wetland total area and number, mainly related to the appearance of wet grassland patches during the wetter years. Wetland cover also showed high inter-annual variability and their area for a given year was positively correlated to precipitation intensities in the three months prior to the image date. Also, round wetlands located in highly glacier- ized catchments were less prone to drying, while relatively small wetlands with irregularly shaped contours suffered the highest rates of drying over the last three decades. High Andean wetlands can therefore be considered as ecosystem sentinels for climate change, as they seem sensitive to glacier melting. Beyond the specific focus of this study, our work illustrates how satellite-based monitoring of ecosystem sentinels can help filling the lack of information on the ecological consequences of current and changing climate conditions, a common and crucial issue especially in less-developed countries.},

  abstract = {To study the effects of malaria-control interventions on parasite population genomics, we examined a set of 1,007 samples of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum collected in Thiès, Senegal between 2006 and 2013. The parasite samples were genotyped using a molecular barcode of 24 SNPs. About 35\% of the samples grouped into subsets with identical barcodes, varying in size by year and sometimes persisting across years. The barcodes also formed networks of related groups. Analysis of 164 completely sequenced parasites revealed extensive sharing of genomic regions. In at least two cases we found first-generation recombinant offspring of parents whose genomes are similar or identical to genomes also present in the sample. An epidemiological model that tracks parasite genotypes can reproduce the observed pattern of barcode subsets. Quantification of likelihoods in the model strongly suggests a reduction of transmission from 2006-2010 with a significant rebound in 2012-2013. The reduced transmission and rebound were confirmed directly by incidence data from Thiès. These findings imply that intensive intervention to control malaria results in rapid and dramatic changes in parasite population genomics. The results also suggest that genomics combined with epidemiological modeling may afford prompt, continuous, and cost-effective tracking of progress toward malaria elimination.},

Samples were collected from December, 2001 to December, 2005 at three localities, Aguas Blancas, El Oculto and San Ramón de la Nueva Orán. We collected 11,206 adult Anopheles species, with the major abundance observed at El Oculto (59.11\%), followed by Aguas Blancas (22.10\%) and San Ramón de la Nueva Orán (18.79\%). Anopheles pseudopunctipennis was the most abundant species at El Oculto, Anopheles argyritarsis predominated in Aguas Blancas, and Anopheles strodei in San Ramón de la Nueva Orán. Samples were collected throughout the sampling period, with the highest peaks during the spring seasons.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A commonly used measure of malaria transmission intensity is the entomological inoculation rate (EIR), defined as the product of the human biting rate (HBR) and sporozoite infection rate (SIR). The EIR excludes molecular parameters that may influence vector control and surveillance strategies. The purpose of this study was to investigate Anopheles multiple blood feeding behavior (MBF) and Plasmodium falciparum multiplicity of infection (MOI) within the mosquito host in Nchelenge District, northern Zambia. Mosquitoes were collected from light traps and pyrethroid spray catch in Nchelenge in the 2013 wet season. All anophelines were tested for blood meal host, P. falciparum, and MOI using PCR. Circumsporozoite (CSP) ELISA and microsatellite analysis were performed to detect parasites in the mosquito and MBF, respectively. Statistical analyses used regression models to assess MBF and MOI and exact binomial test for human sex bias. Both MBF and MOI can enhance our understanding of malaria transmission dynamics beyond what is currently understood through conventional EIR estimates alone. RESULTS: The dominant malaria vectors collected in Nchelenge were Anopheles funestus (sensu stricto) and An. gambiae (s.s.) The EIRs of An. funestus (s.s.) and An. gambiae (s.s.) were 39.6 infectious bites/person/6~months (ib/p/6mo) and 5.9 ib/p/6mo, respectively, and took multiple human blood meals at high rates, 23.2 and 25.7\% respectively. There was no bias in human host sex preference in the blood meals. The SIR was further characterized for parasite genetic diversity. The overall P. falciparum MOI was 6.4 in infected vectors, exceeding previously reported average MOIs in humans in Africa. CONCLUSIONS: Both Anopheles MBF rates and P. falciparum MOI in Nchelenge were among some of the highest reported in sub-Saharan Africa. The results suggest an underestimation of the EIR and large numbers of circulating parasite clones. Together, the results describe important molecular aspects of transmission excluded from the traditional EIR measurement. These elements may provide more sensitive measures with which to assess changes in transmission intensity and risk in vector and parasite surveillance programs.},

This paper reports on discussions and findings from two virtual “Workflows Community Summits” (January and April, 2021). The overarching goals of these workshops were to develop a view of the state of the art, identify crucial research challenges in the workflows community, articulate a vision for potential community efforts, and discuss technical approaches for realizing this vision. To this end, participants identified six broad themes: FAIR computational workflows; AI workflows; exascale challenges; APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards; training and education; and building a workflows community. We summarize discussions and recommendations for each of these themes.},

  abstract = {Mozambique is one of the four African countries which account for over half of all malaria deaths worldwide, yet little is known about the parasite genetic structure in that country. We performed P. falciparum amplicon and whole genome sequencing on 2251 malaria-infected blood samples collected in 2015 and 2018 in seven provinces of Mozambique to genotype antimalarial resistance markers and interrogate parasite population structure using genome-wide microhaplotyes. Here we show that the only resistance-associated markers observed at frequencies above 5\% were pfmdr1-184F (59\%), pfdhfr-51I/59\,R/108\,N (99\%) and pfdhps-437G/540E (89\%). The frequency of pfdhfr/pfdhps quintuple mutants associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance increased from 80\% in 2015 to 89\% in 2018 (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), with a lower expected heterozygosity and higher relatedness of microhaplotypes surrounding pfdhps mutants than wild-type parasites suggestive of recent selection. pfdhfr/pfdhps quintuple mutants also increased from 72\% in the north to 95\% in the south (2018; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). This resistance gradient was accompanied by a concentration of mutations at pfdhps-436 (17\%) in the north, a south-to-north increase in the genetic complexity of P. falciparum infections (p\,=\,0.001) and a microhaplotype signature of regional differentiation. The parasite population structure identified here offers insights to guide antimalarial interventions and epidemiological surveys.},

Recently, knowlesi malaria has become the predominant malaria affecting humans in Malaysian Borneo, being responsible for approximately 70\% of reported cases. Largely as a result of anthropogenic land use changes in Borneo, vectors which transmit the parasite, along with macaque hosts, are both now frequently found in disturbed forest habitats, or at the forest fringes, thus having more frequent contact with humans. Having access to human hosts provides the parasite with the opportunity to further its adaption to the human immune system. The ecological drivers of the transmission and spread of P. knowlesi are operating over many different spatial (and, therefore, temporal) scales, from the molecular to the continental. Strategies to prevent and manage zoonoses, such as P. knowlesi malaria require interdisciplinary research exploring the impact of land use change and biodiversity loss on the evolving relationship between parasite, reservoir hosts, vectors, and humans over multiple spatial scales.},

Based on RFLP analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, peach X-disease phytoplasma strains from eastern and western United States and eastern Canada were classified in 16S rDNA RFLP group 16SrIII, subgroup A. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the X-disease phytoplasma strains formed a distinct subclade within the phytoplasma clade and supported the hypothesis that they represent a lineage distinct from those of previously described 'Candidatus Phytoplasma' species. Nucleotide sequence alignments revealed that all studied X-disease phytoplasma strains shared less than 97.5 \% similarity of 16S rDNA with previously described 'Candidatus Phytoplasma' species. Based on unique properties of DNA, we propose recognition of X-disease phytoplasma strain PX11CT1R as representative of a novel taxon, 'Candidatus Phytoplasma pruni'. Results from nucleotide and phylogenetic analyses of secY and ribosomal protein (rp) gene sequences provided additional molecular markers of the 'Candidatus Phytoplasma' lineage. We propose that the term 'Candidatus Phytoplasma pruni' be applied to phytoplasma strains whose 16S rRNA gene sequences contain the oligonucleotide sequences of unique regions that are designated in the formally published description of the species. Such strains include X-disease phytoplasma and - within the tolerance of a single base difference in one unique sequence - peach rosette, peach red suture, and little peach phytoplasmas. We further propose that secY, rp, and other genetic loci from the reference strain of a species, and where possible oligonucleotide sequences of unique regions of those genes that distinguish species within a given 16Sr group, be incorporated in amended descriptions and as part of future descriptions of 'Candidatus Phytoplasma' species.},

  abstract = {Existing theory on competition for hosts between pathogen strains has proposed that immune selection can lead to the maintenance of strain structure consisting of discrete, weakly overlapping antigenic repertoires. This prediction of strain theory has conceptual overlap with fundamental ideas in ecology on niche partitioning and limiting similarity between coexisting species in an ecosystem, which oppose the hypothesis of neutral coexistence. For Plasmodium falciparum, strain theory has been specifically proposed in relation to the major surface antigen of the blood stage, known as PfEMP1 and encoded by the multicopy multigene family known as the var genes. Deep sampling of the DBLα domain of var genes in the local population of Bakoumba, West Africa, was completed to define whether patterns of repertoire overlap support a role of immune selection under the opposing force of high outcrossing, a characteristic of areas of intense malaria transmission. Using a 454 high-throughput sequencing protocol, we report extremely high diversity of the DBLα domain and a large parasite population with DBLα repertoires structured into nonrandom patterns of overlap. Such population structure, significant for the high diversity of var genes that compose it at a local level, supports the existence of "strains" characterized by distinct var gene repertoires. Nonneutral, frequency-dependent competition would be at play and could underlie these patterns. With a computational experiment that simulates an intervention similar to mass drug administration, we argue that the observed repertoire structure matters for the antigenic var diversity of the parasite population remaining after intervention.},

These systems are characterized by small, heterogeneous, and often indistinct field patterns, requiring a specialized methodology to map agricultural land cover. Using a variety of sites in South Africa, we present a new approach to mapping agricultural fields, based on efficient extraction of a vast set of simple, highly correlated, and interdependent features, followed by a random forest classifier. We achieved similar high performance across agricultural types, including the spectrally indistinct smallholder fields as well as the more easily distinguishable commercial fields, and demonstrated the ability to generalize performance across large geographic areas. In sensitivity analyses, we determined multi-temporal information provided greater gains in performance than the addition of multi-spectral bands available in DigitalGlobe Worldview-2 imagery.},

We release software that facilitates flexible design of amplicon sequencing panels and use this software to design two target panels for P. falciparum. The panels generate 3-4\,kbp reads for eight and sixteen targets respectively, covering key drug-resistance associated genes, diagnostic test antigens, polymorphic markers and the vaccine target csp. We validate our approach on mock and field samples, demonstrating robust sequencing coverage, accurate variant calls within coding sequences, the ability to explore P. falciparum within-sample diversity and to detect deletions underlying rapid diagnostic test failure.},

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax genomes is providing insights into parasite genetic diversity, transmission patterns, and can inform decision making for clinical and surveillance purposes. Advances in sequencing technologies are helping to generate timely and big genomic datasets, with the prospect of applying Artificial Intelligence analytical techniques (e.g., machine learning) to support programmatic malaria control and elimination. Here, we assess the potential of applying deep learning convolutional neural network approaches to predict the geographic origin of infections (continents, countries, GPS locations) using WGS data of P. falciparum (n\,=\,5957; 27 countries) and P. vivax (n\,=\,659; 13 countries) isolates. Using identified high-quality genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (P. falciparum: 750~k, P. vivax: 588~k), an analysis of population structure and ancestry revealed clustering at the country-level. When predicting locations for both species, classification (compared to regression) methods had the lowest distance errors, and\,{$>$}\,90\% accuracy at a country level. Our work demonstrates the utility of machine learning approaches for geo-classification of malaria parasites. With timelier WGS data generation across more malaria-affected regions, the performance of machine learning approaches for geo-classification will improve, thereby supporting disease control activities.},

Data from four gauging stations downstream of Vientiane, Laos, were used, covering two distinct hydrological regions within the Mekong basin. These time series span through over 70 years and are the longest daily discharge time series available in the region. The methods used, Mann Kendal test (MK), ordinary least squares with resampling (OLS) and non-stationary generalized extreme value function (NSGEV), are first tested in a Monte Carlo experiment, in order to evaluate their detection power in presence of changing variance in the time series. The time series are generated using the generalized extreme value function with varying scale and location parameter. NSGEV outperforms MK and OLS, both because it resulted in less type II errors, but also because it allows for a more complete description of the trends, allowing to separate trends in average and in variability. Results from MK, OLS and NSGEV agreed on trends in average flood behaviour. However, the introduction of a time-varying scale parameter in the NSGEV allowed to isolate flood variability from the trend in average flood and to have a more complete view of the changes. Overall, results showed an increasing likelihood of extreme floods during the last half of the century, although the probability of an average flood decreased during the same period. A period of enhanced variance in the last quarter of the 20th century, estimated with the wavelet power spectrum as a function of time, was identified, which confirmed the results of the NSGEV. We conclude that the absence of detected positive trends in the hydrological time series was a methodological misconception due to over-simplistic models.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phylogenetic analysis is now an important tool in the study of viral outbreaks. It can reconstruct epidemic history when surveillance epidemiology data are sparse, and can indicate transmission linkages among infections that may not otherwise be evident. However, a remaining challenge is to develop an analytical framework that can test hypotheses about the effect of environmental variables on pathogen spatial spread. Recent phylogeographic approaches can reconstruct the history of virus dispersal from sampled viral genomes and infer the locations of ancestral infections. Such methods provide a unique source of spatio-temporal information, and are exploited here. RESULTS: We present and apply a new statistical framework that combines genomic and geographic data to test the impact of environmental variables on the mode and tempo of pathogen dispersal during emerging epidemics. First, the spatial history of an emerging pathogen is estimated using standard phylogeographic methods. The inferred dispersal path for each phylogenetic lineage is then assigned a "weight" using environmental data (e.g. altitude, land cover). Next, tests measure the association between each environmental variable and lineage movement. A randomisation procedure is used to assess statistical confidence and we validate this approach using simulated data. We apply our new framework to a set of gene sequences from an epidemic of rabies virus in North American raccoons. We test the impact of six different environmental variables on this epidemic and demonstrate that elevation is associated with a slower rabies spread in a natural population. CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is possible to integrate genomic and environmental data in order to test hypotheses concerning the mode and tempo of virus dispersal during emerging epidemics.},

While a discrete phylogeographic approach can be used to test predictors of transition rates among discrete locations, alternative continuous phylogeographic reconstructions can also be exploited to investigate the impact of underlying environmental layers on the dispersal velocity of a virus. The two approaches are complementary tools for studying pathogens' spread, but in both cases, care must be taken to avoid misinterpretations. Here, we analyse rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) sequence data from West and East Africa to illustrate how both approaches can be used to study the impact of environmental factors on the virus' dispersal frequency and velocity. While it was previously reported that host connectivity was a major determinant of RYMV spread, we show that this was a false positive result due to the lack of appropriate negative controls. We also discuss and compare the phylodynamic tools currently available for investigating the impact of environmental factors on virus spread.},

Spatially explicit reconstructions of viral spread represent valuable sources of lineage movement data that can be exploited to investigate the impact of underlying environmental layers on the dispersal of pathogens. Here, we performed phylogeographic inference and applied different post hoc approaches to analyse a new and comprehensive data set of viral genomes to elucidate the dispersal history and dynamics of rabies virus (RABV) in Iran, which have remained largely unknown. We first analysed the association between environmental factors and variations in dispersal velocity among lineages. Second, we present, test and apply a new approach to study the link between environmental conditions and the dispersal direction of lineages. The statistical performance (power of detection, false-positive rate) of this new method was assessed using simulations. We performed phylogeographic analyses of RABV genomes, allowing us to describe the large diversity of RABV in Iran and to confirm the cocirculation of several clades in the country. Overall, we estimate a relatively high lineage dispersal velocity, similar to previous estimates for dog rabies virus spread in northern Africa. Finally, we highlight a tendency for RABV lineages to spread in accessible areas associated with high human population density. Our analytical workflow illustrates how phylogeographic approaches can be used to investigate the impact of environmental factors on several aspects of viral dispersal dynamics.},

In response, sufficient land must be set aside for conservation to preserve long-term biodiversity. In this paper, we propose a bi-objective optimization model to form spatially cohesive nature reserves by minimizing the distance from habitat patches to the center of their reserve, while simultaneously maximizing the ecological condition of the patches set aside for preservation. Our model can accommodate multiple reserves which, combined with a minimum separation distance requirement, enforces backup coverage to mitigate the possible effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors. The model fully capitalizes on GIS functionalities to extract information on spatial relationships and visualize optimization results. Given the complexity of the separation constraint, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) and a two-phase heuristic where the GA solves the selection of the reserves, while a solver attempts to optimize the allocation of patches to the selected reserves. The behavior of our model and its sensitivity to the parameters are illustrated on a simulated data set, while its real-world problem-solving capabilities are demonstrated on a case study in New Hampshire. Our model provides an alternative modeling tool for conservation planning, particularly when backup reserves are desired.},

We present a multi-period capacitated median model for school network facility location planning that minimizes transportation costs, while functional costs are subject to a budget constraint. The proposed Vintage Flexible Capacitated Location Problem (ViFCLP) has the flexibility to account for a minimum school-age closing requirement, while the maximum capacity of each school can be adjusted by the addition of modular units. Non-closest assignments are controlled by the introduction of a parameter penalizing excess travel. The applicability of the ViFCLP is illustrated on a large US school system (Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina) where high school demand is expected to grow faster with distance to the city center. Higher school capacities and greater penalty on travel impedance parameter reduce the number of non-closest assignments. The proposed model is beneficial to policy makers seeking to improve the provision and efficiency of public services over a multi-period planning horizon.},

  abstract = {In spatial sampling, once initial samples of the primary variable have been collected, it is possible to take additional measurements, an approach known as second-phase sampling. Additional samples are usually collected away from observation locations, or where the kriging variance is maximum. However, the kriging variance (also known as prediction-error variance) is independent of data values and computed under the assumption of stationary spatial process, which is often violated in practice. In this paper, we weight the kriging variance with another criterion, giving greater sampling importance to locations exhibiting significant spatial roughness that is computed by a spatial moving average window. Additional samples are allocated using a simulated annealing procedure since the weighted objective function is non-linear. A case study using an exhaustive remote sensing image illustrates the procedure. Combinations of first-phase systematic and nested sampling designs (or patterns) of varying densities are generated, while the location of additional observations is guided in a way which optimizes the proposed objective function. The true pixel value at the new points is extracted, the semivariogram, model updated, and the image reconstructed. Second-phase sampling patterns optimizing the proposed criterion lead to predictions closer to the true image than when using the kriging variance as the main criterion. This improvement is stronger when there is a low density of first-phase samples, and decreases however as the initial density increases. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Americas were the last continent colonized by humans carrying malaria parasites. Plasmodium falciparum from the New World shows very little genetic diversity and greater linkage disequilibrium, compared with its African counterparts, and is clearly subdivided into local, highly divergent populations. However, limited available data have revealed extensive genetic diversity in American populations of another major human malaria parasite, P. vivax. METHODS: We used an improved sample preparation strategy and next-generation sequencing to characterize 9 high-quality P. vivax genome sequences from northwestern Brazil. These new data were compared with publicly available sequences from recently sampled clinical P. vivax isolates from Brazil (BRA, total n = 11 sequences), Peru (PER, n = 23), Colombia (COL, n = 31), and Mexico (MEX, n = 19). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: We found that New World populations of P. vivax are as diverse (nucleotide diversity π between 5.2 × 10-4 and 6.2 × 10-4) as P. vivax populations from Southeast Asia, where malaria transmission is substantially more intense. They display several non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions (some of them previously undescribed) in genes known or suspected to be involved in antimalarial drug resistance, such as dhfr, dhps, mdr1, mrp1, and mrp-2, but not in the chloroquine resistance transporter ortholog (crt-o) gene. Moreover, P. vivax in the Americas is much less geographically substructured than local P. falciparum populations, with relatively little between-population genome-wide differentiation (pairwise FST values ranging between 0.025 and 0.092). Finally, P. vivax populations show a rapid decline in linkage disequilibrium with increasing distance between pairs of polymorphic sites, consistent with very frequent outcrossing. We hypothesize that the high diversity of present-day P. vivax lineages in the Americas originated from successive migratory waves and subsequent admixture between parasite lineages from geographically diverse sites. Further genome-wide analyses are required to test the demographic scenario suggested by our data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is a neglected human malaria parasite that causes significant morbidity in the Americas, the Middle East, Asia, and the Western Pacific. Population genomic approaches remain little explored to map local and regional transmission pathways of P. vivax across the main endemic sites in the Americas, where great progress has been made towards malaria elimination over the past decades. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyze 38 patient-derived P. vivax genome sequences from Mâncio Lima (ML)-the Amazonian malaria hotspot next to the Brazil-Peru border-and 24 sequences from two other sites in Acre State, Brazil, a country that contributes 23\% of malaria cases in the Americas. We show that the P. vivax population of ML is genetically diverse (π = 4.7 × 10-4), with a high polymorphism particularly in genes encoding proteins putatively involved in red blood cell invasion. Paradoxically, however, parasites display strong genome-wide linkage disequilibrium, being fragmented into discrete lineages that are remarkably stable across time and space, with only occasional recombination between them. Using identity-by-descent approaches, we identified a large cluster of closely related sequences that comprises 16 of 38 genomes sampled in ML over 26 months. Importantly, we found significant ancestry sharing between parasites at a large geographic distance, consistent with substantial gene flow between regional P. vivax populations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have characterized the sustained expansion of highly inbred P. vivax lineages in a malaria hotspot that can seed regional transmission. Potential source populations in hotspots represent a priority target for malaria elimination in the Amazon.},

  abstract = {The concept of a fundamental ecological niche is central to questions of geographic distribution, population demography, species conservation, and evolutionary potential. However, robust inference of genomic regions associated with evolutionary adaptation to particular environmental conditions remains difficult due to the myriad of potential confounding processes that can generate heterogeneous patterns of variation across the genome. Here, we interrogate the potential role of genome environment association (GEA) testing as an initial step in building an understanding of the genetic basis of ecological niche. We leverage publicly available genomic data from the Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes (Ag1000g) Consortium to test the ability of multiple analytically unique GEA methods to handle confounding patterns of genetic variation, control false positive rates, and discern associations with broadly relevant climate variables from random allele frequency patterns throughout the genome. We found evidence supporting the ability of commonly implemented GEA methods to account for confounding patterns of spatial and genetic variation, and control false positive rates. However, we fail to find evidence supporting the ability of GEA tests to reject signals of adaptation to randomly simulated environmental variables, indicating that discerning between true signals of genome environment adaptation and genome environment correlations resulting from alternative evolutionary processes, remains challenging. Because signals of environmental adaptation are so diffuse and confounded throughout the genome, we argue that genomic adaptation to ecological niche is likely best understood under an omnigenic model wherein highly interconnected, genome-wide gene regulatory networks shape genomic adaptation to key environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {The Minimum Evolution (ME) approach to phylogeny estimation has been shown to be statistically consistent when it is used in conjunction with ordinary least-squares (OLS) fitting of a metric to a tree structure. The traditional approach to using ME has been to start with the Neighbor Joining (NJ) topology for a given matrix and then do a topological search from that starting point. The first stage requires O(n(3)) time, where n is the number of taxa, while the current implementations of the second are in O(p n(3)) or more, where p is the number of swaps performed by the program. In this paper, we examine a greedy approach to minimum evolution which produces a starting topology in O(n(2)) time. Moreover, we provide an algorithm that searches for the best topology using nearest neighbor interchanges (NNIs), where the cost of doing p NNIs is O(n(2) + p n), i.e., O(n(2)) in practice because p is always much smaller than n. The Greedy Minimum Evolution (GME) algorithm, when used in combination with NNIs, produces trees which are fairly close to NJ trees in terms of topological accuracy. We also examine ME under a balanced weighting scheme, where sibling subtrees have equal weight, as opposed to the standard "unweighted" OLS, where all taxa have the same weight so that the weight of a subtree is equal to the number of its taxa. The balanced minimum evolution scheme (BME) runs slower than the OLS version, requiring O(n(2) x diam(T)) operations to build the starting tree and O(p n x diam(T)) to perform the NNIs, where diam(T) is the topological diameter of the output tree. In the usual Yule-Harding distribution on phylogenetic trees, the diameter expectation is in log(n), so our algorithms are in practice faster that NJ. Moreover, this BME scheme yields a very significant improvement over NJ and other distance-based algorithms, especially with large trees, in terms of topological accuracy.},

  abstract = {Background Drug resistant malaria is a growing concern in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where previous studies indicate that parasites resistant to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine or chloroquine are spatially clustered. This study explores longitudinal changes in spatial patterns to understand how resistant malaria may be spreading within the DRC, using samples from nation-wide population-representative surveys. Methods We selected 552 children with PCR-detectable Plasmodium falciparum infection and identified known variants in the pfdhps and pfcrt genes associated with resistance. We compared the proportion of mutant parasites in 2013 to those previously reported from adults in 2007, and identified risk factors for carrying a resistant allele using multivariate mixed-effects modeling. Finally, we fit a spatial-temporal model to the observed data, providing smooth allele frequency estimates over space and time. Results The proportion of co-occurring pfdhps K540E/A581G mutations increased by 16\% between 2007 and 2013. The spatial-temporal model suggests that the spatial range of the pfdhps double mutants expanded over time, while the prevalence and range of pfcrt mutations remained steady. Conclusions This study uses population-representative samples to describe the changing landscape of SP resistance within the DRC, and the persistence of chloroquine resistance. Vigilant molecular surveillance is critical for controlling the spread of resistance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is increasingly recognized that climate change can alter the geographical distribution of vector-borne diseases (VBDs) with shifts of disease vectors to higher altitudes and latitudes. In particular, an increasing risk of malaria and dengue fever epidemics in tropical highlands and temperate regions has been predicted in different climate change scenarios. The aim of this paper is to expand the current knowledge on the seasonal occurrence and altitudinal distribution of malaria and other disease vectors in eastern Nepal. METHODS: Adult mosquitoes resting indoors and outdoors were collected using CDC light trap and aspirators with the support of flash light. Mosquito larvae were collected using locally constructed dippers. We assessed the local residents' perceptions of the distribution and occurrence of mosquitoes using key informant interview techniques. Generalized linear models were fitted to assess the effect of season, resting site and topography on the abundance of malaria vectors. RESULTS: The known malaria vectors in Nepal, Anopheles fluviatilis, Anopheles annularis and Anopheles maculatus complex members were recorded from 70 to 1,820 m above sea level (asl). The vectors of chikungunya and dengue virus, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, the vector of lymphatic filariasis, Culex quinquefasciatus, and that of Japanese encephalitis, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, were found from 70 to 2,000 m asl in eastern Nepal. Larvae of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes species were recorded up to 2,310 m asl. Only season had a significant effect on the abundance of An. fluviatilis, season and resting site on the abundance of An. maculatus complex members, and season, resting site and topography on the abundance of An. annularis. The perceptions of people on mosquito occurrence are consistent with entomological findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first vertical distribution records of vector mosquitoes in eastern Nepal and suggests that the vectors of malaria and other diseases have already established populations in the highlands due to climatic and other environmental changes. As VBD control programmes have not been focused on the highlands of Nepal, these findings call for actions to start monitoring, surveillance and research on VBDs in these previously disease-free, densely populated and economically important regions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Risks of malaria epidemics in relation to El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events have been mapped and studied at global level. In India, where malaria is a major public health problem, no such effort has been undertaken that inter-relates El Niño, Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) and malaria. The present study has been undertaken to find out the relationship between ENSO events, ISMR and intra-annual variability in malaria cases in India, which in turn could help mitigate the malaria outbreaks. METHODS: Correlation coefficients among 'rainfall index' (ISMR), '+ winter ONI' (NDJF) and 'malaria case index' were calculated using annual state-level data for the last 22~years. The 'malaria case index' representing 'relative change from mean' was correlated to the 4~month (November-February) average positive Oceanic Niño Index (ONI). The resultant correlations between '+ winter ONI' and 'malaria case index' were further analysed on geographical information system platform to generate spatial correlation map. RESULTS: The correlation between '+ winter ONI' and 'rainfall index' shows that there is great disparity in effect of ENSO over ISMR distribution across the country. Correlation between 'rainfall index' and 'malaria case index' shows that malaria transmission in all geographical regions of India are not equally affected by the ISMR deficit or excess. Correlation between '+ winter ONI' and 'malaria case index' was found ranging from -0.5 to~+~0.7 (p~{$<~$}0.05). A positive correlation indicates that increase in El Niño intensity (+ winter ONI) will lead to rise in total malaria cases in the concurrent year in the states of Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Goa, eastern parts of Madhya Pradesh, part of Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Meghalaya. Whereas, negative correlations were found in the states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat, part of Tamil Nadu, Manipur, Mizoram and Sikkim indicating the likelihood of outbreaks in La Nina condition. CONCLUSIONS: The generated map, representing spatial correlation between '~+ winter ONI' and 'malaria case index', indicates positive correlations in eastern part, while negative correlations in western part of India. This study provides plausible guidelines to national programme for planning intervention measures in view of ENSO events. For better resolution, district level study with inclusion of IOD and 'epochal variation of monsoon rainfall' factors at micro-level is desired for better forecast of malaria outbreaks in the regions with 'no correlation'.},

The availability of this data has huge potential to deliver new insights into the evolution and epidemiology of bacterial pathogens, but the scalability of the analytical methodology has been lagging behind that of the sequencing technology. Here we present a step-by-step approach for such large-scale genomic epidemiology analyses, from bacterial genomes to epidemiological interpretations. A central component of this approach is the dated phylogeny, which is a phylogenetic tree with branch lengths measured in units of time. The construction of dated phylogenies from bacterial genomic data needs to account for the disruptive effect of recombination on phylogenetic relationships, and we describe how this can be achieved. Dated phylogenies can then be used to perform fine-scale or large-scale epidemiological analyses, depending on the proportion of cases for which genomes are available. A key feature of this approach is computational scalability and in particular the ability to process hundreds or thousands of genomes within a matter of hours. This is a clear advantage of the step-by-step approach described here. We discuss other advantages and disadvantages of the approach, as well as potential improvements and avenues for future research.

This study examined polyclonal infections and the associations of parasite genetic variations with binding affinity to human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Multiplicity of infection was determined by amplicon deep sequencing of PfMSP1. Genetic variations in PfCSP were examined across 88 samples from Ghana and analyzed together with 1655 PfCSP sequences from other African and non-African isolates. Binding interactions of PfCSP peptide variants and HLA were predicted using NetChop and HADDOCK. High polyclonality was detected among infections, with each infection harboring multiple non-3D7 PfCSP variants. Twenty-seven PfCSP haplotypes were detected in the Ghanaian samples, and they broadly represented PfCSP diversity across Africa. The number of genetic differences between 3D7 and non-3D7 PfCSP variants does not influence binding to HLA. However, CSP peptide length after proteolytic degradation significantly affects its molecular weight and binding affinity to HLA. Despite the high diversity of HLA, the majority of the HLAI and II alleles interacted/bound with all Ghana CSP peptides. Multiple non-3D7 strains among P. falciparum infections could impact the effectiveness of RTS,S. Longer peptides of the Th2R/Th3R CSP regions should be considered in future versions of RTS,S.},

  abstract = {Over 80\% of all malaria deaths occur in children under 5 years of age. Malaria control strategies have been progressively shifted to specific populations and/or areas to maximize effectiveness. Malaria is a significant public health problem in Ghana. Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) using a combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine has been implemented since 2015 in northern Ghana where malaria transmission is intense and seasonal. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum carriers in three ecological zones of Ghana, and compared the sensitivity and specificity of different molecular methods in identifying asymptomatic infections. Moreover, we examined the frequency of mutations in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, and pfdhps that relate to the ongoing SMC. A total of 535 asymptomatic schoolchildren were screened by microscopy and PCR (18s rRNA and TARE-2) methods. Among all samples, 28.6\% were detected as positive by 18S nested PCR, whereas 19.6\% were detected by microscopy. A high PCR-based asymptomatic prevalence was observed in the north (51\%) compared to in the central (27.8\%) and south (16.9\%). The prevalence of pfdhfr-N51I/C59R/S108N/pfdhps-A437G quadruple mutant associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance was significantly higher in the north where SMC was implemented. Compared to 18S rRNA, TARE-2 serves as a more sensitive molecular marker for detecting submicroscopic asymptomatic infections in high and low transmission settings. These findings establish a baseline for monitoring P. falciparum prevalence and resistance in response to SMC over time. Ghana is also one of the three African countries where the world’s first malaria vaccine, RTS, S, was launched recently. The vaccine contains part of the central repeat region and the complete C-terminal of the circumsporozoite protein (CSPiv gene of the 3D7 strain. Polymorphism in the PfCSP protein has been reported from several parts of the world. However, whether RTS, S-induced immunity is PfCSP allele-dependent and if selection favors non-3D7 strains are unclear. This study aims to examine the genetic polymorphism of the PfCSP genes in clinical P. falciparum cases and provide a baseline of parasite diversity prior to vaccine implementation in Ghana. A total of 212 clinical samples were collected from Seikwa located in the Brong Afrong region where the vaccine is currently being deployed. Preliminary data indicated a high rate of polyclonal infections, with some samples harboring up to 3 clones based on the allele frequency among mapped reads. Parasite clones detected within the same host were not genetically similar to one another. Instead, they were distributed in various subclades and closely related to clones identified from other hosts. It is yet to be investigated if the high PfCSP haplotype diversity and low resemblance to the 3D7 strain have an impact on the anti-CSP immune response and thereby the efficacy of RTS,S.},

  abstract = {Most angiosperm nuclear DNA is repetitive and derived from silenced transposable elements (TEs). TE silencing requires substantial resources from the plant host, including the production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Thus, the interaction between TEs and siRNAs is a critical aspect of both the function and the evolution of plant genomes. Yet the co-evolutionary dynamics between these two entities remain poorly characterized. Here we studied the organization of TEs within the maize (Zea mays ssp mays) genome, documenting that TEs fall within three groups based on the class and copy numbers. These groups included DNA elements, low copy RNA elements and higher copy RNA elements. The three groups varied statistically in characteristics that included length, location, age, siRNA expression and 24∶22 nucleotide (nt) siRNA targeting ratios. In addition, the low copy retroelements encompassed a set of TEs that had previously been shown to decrease expression within a 24 nt siRNA biogenesis mutant (mop1). To investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the three groups, we estimated their abundance in two landraces, one with a genome similar in size to that of the maize reference and the other with a 30\% larger genome. For all three accessions, we assessed TE abundance as well as 22 nt and 24 nt siRNA content within leaves. The high copy number retroelements are under targeted similarly by siRNAs among accessions, appear to be born of a rapid bust of activity, and may be currently transpositionally dead or limited. In contrast, the lower copy number group of retrolements are targeted more dynamically and have had a long and ongoing history of transposition in the maize genome.},

  abstract = {Most evolutionary processes occur in a spatial context and several spatial analysis techniques have been employed in an exploratory context. However, the existence of autocorrelation can also perturb significance tests when data is analyzed using standard correlation and regression techniques on modeling genetic data as a function of explanatory variables. In this case, more complex models incorporating the effects of autocorrelation must be used. Here we review those models and compared their relative performances in a simple simulation, in which spatial patterns in allele frequencies were generated by a balance between random variation within populations and spatially-structured gene flow. Notwithstanding the somewhat idiosyncratic behavior of the techniques evaluated, it is clear that spatial autocorrelation affects Type I errors and that standard linear regression does not provide minimum variance estimators. Due to its flexibility, we stress that principal coordinate of neighbor matrices (PCNM) and related eigenvector mapping techniques seem to be the best approaches to spatial regression. In general, we hope that our review of commonly used spatial regression techniques in biology and ecology may aid population geneticists towards providing better explanations for population structures dealing with more complex regression problems throughout geographic space.},

  abstract = {Grain yield maps must accurately display general yield patterns as well as details of local yield variation. Different geostatistical procedures for creating interpolated yield maps by integrating yield data with remotely sensed vegetation indices (VI) were evaluated. Yield monitor data and a multispectral satellite image at 4-m spatial resolution were collected in an irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) field and a rainfed soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] field. Ordinary kriging (OK), cokriging (CK), simple kriging with varying local means (SKLM), and kriging with external drift (KED) were compared using grain yield as primary variable and three different VI as secondary variables. At both sites, SKLM performed best in terms of the precision of grain yield maps and maps that depicted true yield patterns. Utilizing the most suitable vegetation index at each site and SKLM as interpolation method, the root mean squared error of yield predictions was increased by nearly 20\% over OK. Methods such as KED or CK resulted in only small improvement of yield maps over those obtained with OK. Utilizing the satellite image decreased errors associated with yield monitor operations and allowed better prediction in areas where no reliable yield measurements were available. Due to the robust nature of modeling the relationship between primary and one or more secondary variables, the SKLM method has considerable potential for use in commercial precision-farming software. Future efforts on improving yield mapping should concentrate on obtaining improved yield monitor data and imagery and developing yield-sensitive VI for high-yielding crops.},

  abstract = {Accurate maps of surface water are essential for many environmental applications. Surface water maps can be generated by combining measurements from multiple sources. Precise estimation of surface water using satellite imagery remains a challenging task due to the sensor limitations, complex land cover, topography, and atmospheric conditions. As a complementary dataset, in the case of hilly landscapes, a drainage network can be extracted from high-resolution digital elevation models. Additionally, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) initiatives, such as OpenStreetMap, can also be used to produce high-resolution surface water masks. In this study, we derive a high-resolution water mask using Landsat 8 imagery and OpenStreetMap as well as (potential) a drainage network using 30 m SRTM. Our approach to derive a surface water mask from Landsat 8 imagery comprises the use of a lower 15\% percentile of Landsat 8 Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from 2013 to 2015. We introduce a new non-parametric unsupervised method based on the Canny edge filter and Otsu thresholding to detect water in flat areas. For hilly areas, the method is extended with an additional supervised classification step used to refine the water mask. We applied the method across the Murray-Darling basin, Australia. Differences between our new Landsat-based water mask and the OpenStreetMap water mask regarding positional differences along the rivers and overall coverage were analyzed. Our results show that about 50\% of the OpenStreetMap linear water features can be confirmed using the water mask extracted from Landsat 8 imagery and the drainage network derived from SRTM. We also show that the observed distances between river features derived from OpenStreetMap and Landsat 8 are mostly smaller than 60 m. The differences between the new water mask and SRTM-based linear features and hilly areas are slightly larger (110 m). The overall agreement between OpenStreetMap and Landsat 8 water masks is about 30\%.},

Further, these inventories have shown that small lakes and ponds dominate the areal extent of continental waters, correcting a century- long misconception that large lakes are most important. The global importance of any ecosystem type in a process or cycle is the product of the areal extent and the intensity of the process in those ecosystems. Several analyses have shown the disproportionately great intensity of many processes in small aquatic ecosystems, indicating that they play an unexpectedly major role in global cycles. Assessments of the global carbon cycle underscore the need for aquatic scientists to view their work on a global scale in order to respond to the Earths most pressing environmental problems.},

  abstract = {Disentangling the processes underlying geographic and environmental patterns of biodiversity challenges biologists as such patterns emerge from eco-evolutionary processes confounded by spatial autocorrelation among sample units. The herbivorous insect, Belonocnema treatae (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae), exhibits regional specialization on three plant species whose geographic distributions range from sympatry through allopatry across the southern United States. Using range-wide sampling spanning the geographic ranges of the three host plants and genotyping-by-sequencing of 1,217 individuals, we tested whether this insect herbivore exhibited host plant-associated genomic differentiation while controlling for spatial autocorrelation among the 58 sample sites. Population genomic structure based on 40,699 SNPs was evaluated using the hierarchical Bayesian model entropy to assign individuals to genetic clusters and estimate admixture proportions. To control for spatial autocorrelation, distance-based Moran's eigenvector mapping was used to construct regression variables summarizing spatial structure inherent among sample sites. Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) incorporating the spatial variables was then applied to partition host plant-associated differentiation (HAD) from spatial autocorrelation. By combining entropy and dbRDA to analyse SNP data, we unveiled a complex mosaic of highly structured differentiation within and among gall-former populations finding evidence that geography, HAD and spatial autocorrelation all play significant roles in explaining patterns of genomic differentiation in B. treatae. While dbRDA confirmed host association as a significant predictor of patterns of genomic variation, spatial autocorrelation among sites explained the largest proportion of variation. Our results demonstrate the value of combining dbRDA with hierarchical structural analyses to partition spatial/environmental patterns of genomic variation.},

The impact of sequences sampled through time has been most apparent in the disciplines of RNA viral evolution and ancient DNA, where they enable us to estimate divergence times without paleontological calibrations, and to analyze temporal changes in population size, population structure and substitution rates.

Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed the literature for methods combing epidemiological and genomic data in transmission tree reconstruction. We identified 22 methods from the 41 selected articles. We defined three families according to how genomic data was handled: a non-phylogenetic family, a sequential phylogenetic family, and a simultaneous phylogenetic family. We discussed methods according to the data needed as well as the underlying sequence mutation, within-host evolution, transmission, and case observation. In the non-phylogenetic family consisting of eight methods, pairwise genetic distances were estimated. In the phylogenetic families, transmission trees were inferred from phylogenetic trees either simultaneously (nine methods) or sequentially (five methods). While a majority of methods (17/22) modeled the transmission process, few (8/22) took into account imperfect case detection. Within-host evolution was generally (7/8) modeled as a coalescent process. These practical and theoretical considerations were highlighted in order to help select the appropriate method for an outbreak.},

  abstract = {Landscape genetics lacks explicit methods for dealing with the uncertainty in landscape resistance estimation, which is particularly problematic when sample sizes of individuals are small. Unless uncertainty can be quantified, valuable but small data sets may be rendered unusable for conservation purposes. We offer a method to quantify uncertainty in landscape resistance estimates using multimodel inference as an improvement over single model-based inference. We illustrate the approach empirically using co-occurring, woodland-preferring Australian marsupials within a common study area: two arboreal gliders (Petaurus breviceps, and Petaurus norfolcensis) and one ground-dwelling antechinus (Antechinus flavipes). First, we use maximum-likelihood and a bootstrap procedure to identify the best-supported isolation-by-resistance model out of 56 models defined by linear and non-linear resistance functions. We then quantify uncertainty in resistance estimates by examining parameter selection probabilities from the bootstrapped data. The selection probabilities provide estimates of uncertainty in the parameters that drive the relationships between landscape features and resistance. We then validate our method for quantifying uncertainty using simulated genetic and landscape data showing that for most parameter combinations it provides sensible estimates of uncertainty. We conclude that small data sets can be informative in landscape genetic analyses provided uncertainty can be explicitly quantified. Being explicit about uncertainty in landscape genetic models will make results more interpretable and useful for conservation decision-making, where dealing with uncertainty is critical.},

  abstract = {Landscape genetics offers a powerful approach to understanding species' dispersal patterns. However, a central obstacle is to account for ecological processes operating at multiple spatial scales, while keeping research outcomes applicable to conservation management. We address this challenge by applying a novel multilevel regression approach to model landscape drivers of genetic structure at both the resolution of individuals and at a spatial resolution relevant to management (i.e. local government management areas: LGAs) for the koala (Phascolartos cinereus) in Australia. Our approach allows for the simultaneous incorporation of drivers of landscape-genetic relationships operating at multiple spatial resolutions. Using microsatellite data for 1106 koalas, we show that, at the individual resolution, foliage projective cover (FPC) facilitates high gene flow (i.e. low resistance) until it falls below approximately 30\%. Out of six additional land-cover variables, only highways and freeways further explained genetic distance after accounting for the effect of FPC. At the LGA resolution, there was significant variation in isolation-by-resistance (IBR) relationships in terms of their slopes and intercepts. This was predominantly explained by the average resistance distance among LGAs, with a weaker effect of historical forest cover. Rates of recent landscape change did not further explain variation in IBR relationships among LGAs. By using a novel multilevel model, we disentangle the effect of landscape resistance on gene flow at the fine resolution (i.e. among individuals) from effects occurring at coarser resolutions (i.e. among LGAs). This has important implications for our ability to identify appropriate scale-dependent management actions.},

  abstract = {Patterns of isolation-by-distance (IBD) arise when population differentiation increases with increasing geographic distances. Patterns of IBD are usually caused by local spatial dispersal, which explains why differences of allele frequencies between populations accumulate with distance. However, spatial variations of demographic parameters such as migration rate or population density can generate nonstationary patterns of IBD where the rate at which genetic differentiation accumulates varies across space. To characterize nonstationary patterns of IBD, we infer local genetic differentiation based on Bayesian kriging. Local genetic differentiation for a sampled population is defined as the average genetic differentiation between the sampled population and fictive neighboring populations. To avoid defining populations in advance, the method can also be applied at the scale of individuals making it relevant for landscape genetics. Inference of local genetic differentiation relies on a matrix of pairwise similarity or dissimilarity between populations or individuals such as matrices of between pairs of populations. Simulation studies show that maps of local genetic differentiation can reveal barriers to gene flow but also other patterns such as continuous variations of gene flow across habitat. The potential of the method is illustrated with two datasets: single nucleotide polymorphisms from human Swedish populations and dominant markers for alpine plant species.},

The resulting 89~GHz fw (fwWBand) retrievals provide 10-day temporal fidelity and enhanced (5~km) resolution relative to other passive microwave sensor based land observations. A look-up table was first established to provide reference microwave emissivities for water and land endmembers under a range of atmosphere and land surface conditions. The fwWBand retrievals were then obtained on a per pixel basis using difference ratio and double difference methods for respective barren and vegetated soil conditions. The resulting fwWBand summer (JJA) seasonal composites correspond favorably (R~≥~0.86, p~{$<~$}0.001) with alternative, finer resolution (≤~300~m) static open water maps derived from satellite radar and optical-infrared sensors over a pan-Arctic (≥~45°N) domain. The fwWBand retrievals also capture significant seasonal drought and flooding events inferred from river discharge records within the major Arctic basins. The fwWBand retrievals are found to be reliable for discriminating open water in moderately dense vegetation areas, but with greater uncertainty over barren land. The ability of the fw retrievals to detect surface water under vegetation also decreases exponentially with increasing canopy optical thickness. The new fwWBand dataset provides an improved resolution satellite environmental data record documenting open water patterns and inundation dynamics in boreal-Arctic ecosystems experiencing rapid climate change.},

In this manuscript, we focus on two methodological extensions for landscape genetic analyses: the use of conditional genetic distance (cGD) derived from population networks and the utility of extracting potentially confounding effects caused by correlations between phylogeographic history and contemporary ecological factors. Individual-based simulations show that when describing the spatial distribution of genetic variation, cGD consistently outperforms the traditional genetic distance measure of linearized FST under both 1- and 2-dimensional stepping stone models and Cavalli-Sforza and Edward’s chord distance Dc in 1-dimensional landscapes. To show how to identify and extract the effects of phylogeographic history prior to embarking on landscape genetic analyses, we use nuclear genotypic data from the Sonoran desert succulent Euphorbia lomelii (Euphrobiaceae), for which a detailed phylogeographic history has previously been determined. For E. lomelii, removing the effect of phylogeographic history significantly influences our ability to infer both the identity and the relative importance of spatial and bio-climatic variables in subsequent landscape genetic analyses. We close by discussing the utility of cGD in landscape genetic analyses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deep sequencing of targeted genomic regions is becoming a common tool for understanding the dynamics and complexity of Plasmodium infections, but its lower limit of detection is currently unknown. Here, a new amplicon analysis tool, the Parallel Amplicon Sequencing Error Correction (PASEC) pipeline, is used to evaluate the performance of amplicon sequencing on low-density Plasmodium DNA samples. Illumina-based sequencing of two Plasmodium falciparum genomic regions (CSP and SERA2) was performed on two types of samples: in vitro DNA mixtures mimicking low-density infections (1-200 genomes/μl) and extracted blood spots from a combination of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (44-653,080 parasites/μl). Three additional analysis tools-DADA2, HaplotypR, and SeekDeep-were applied to both datasets and the precision and sensitivity of each tool were evaluated. RESULTS: Amplicon sequencing can contend with low-density samples, showing reasonable detection accuracy down to a concentration of 5 Plasmodium genomes/μl. Due to increased stochasticity and background noise, however, all four tools showed reduced sensitivity and precision on samples with very low parasitaemia ({$<$}\,5 copies/μl) or low read count ({$<$}\,100 reads per amplicon). PASEC could distinguish major from minor haplotypes with an accuracy of 90\% in samples with at least 30 Plasmodium genomes/μl, but only 61\% at low Plasmodium concentrations ({$<$}\,5 genomes/μl) and 46\% at very low read counts ({$<$}\,25 reads per amplicon). The four tools were additionally used on a panel of extracted parasite-positive blood spots from natural malaria infections. While all four identified concordant patterns of complexity of infection (COI) across four sub-Saharan African countries, COI values obtained for individual samples differed in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: Amplicon deep sequencing can be used to determine the complexity and diversity of low-density Plasmodium infections. Despite differences in their approach, four state-of-the-art tools resolved known haplotype mixtures with similar sensitivity and precision. Researchers can therefore choose from multiple robust approaches for analysing amplicon data, however, error filtration approaches should not be uniformly applied across samples~of varying parasitaemia. Samples with very low parasitaemia and very low read count have higher false positive rates and call for read count thresholds that are higher than current default recommendations.},

  abstract = {Malaria is a serious public health threat in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and its transmission risk varies geographically. Modelling its geographic characteristics is essential for identifying the spatial and temporal risk of malaria transmission. Remote sensing (RS) has been serving as an important tool in providing and assessing a variety of potential climatic/environmental malaria transmission variables in diverse areas. This review focuses on the utilization of RS-driven climatic/environmental variables in determining malaria transmission in SSA. A systematic search on Google Scholar and the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge(SM) databases (PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect) was carried out. We identified thirty-five peer-reviewed articles that studied the relationship between remotely-sensed climatic variable(s) and malaria epidemiological data in the SSA sub-regions. The relationship between malaria disease and different climatic/environmental proxies was examined using different statistical methods. Across the SSA sub-region, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from either the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) or Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite sensors was most frequently returned as a statistically-significant variable to model both spatial and temporal malaria transmission. Furthermore, generalized linear models (linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression) were the most frequently-employed methods of statistical analysis in determining malaria transmission predictors in East, Southern and West Africa. By contrast, multivariate analysis was used in Central Africa. We stress that the utilization of RS in determining reliable malaria transmission predictors and climatic/environmental monitoring variables would require a tailored approach that will have cognizance of the geographical/climatic setting, the stage of malaria elimination continuum, the characteristics of the RS variables and the analytical approach, which in turn, would support the channeling of intervention resources sustainably.},

  abstract = {Not all exotic species establish and expand aggressively (i.e. become invasive). As potential vectors of disease agents, invasive mosquitoes can have considerable impact on public health, livestock and wildlife; therefore, understanding the species characteristics and ecological circumstances promoting their invasiveness is important. The mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus, originally from north-east Asia, was introduced at least two separate times to the north-eastern USA, as surmised from the initial existence of two populations with distinct nuclear and mitochondrial genetic signatures that later intermixed. Since these original introductions in the late 1990s, Ae.~j.~japonicus has expanded across 31 US states, two Canadian provinces and five European countries. Although some of the expanded range was due to other independent introductions, to understand what drove the postintroduction expansion of Ae.~j.~japonicus within the north-eastern USA, we performed a high-resolution landscape genetic analysis of 461 specimens collected across Virginia, a state south of the original introductions. All specimens were genotyped at seven pre-optimized microsatellite loci, and a subsample was sequenced at one mitochondrial locus. We concluded that throughout Virginia this species has primarily expanded in association with humans: genetic distance and distance along roads remained correlated after controlling for geographic distance, and proximity to I-95, a major interstate highway, strongly predicted nuclear ancestry. In contrast, there was very limited evidence of diffusion even at distances potentially suitable for autonomous mosquito flight. This implies that its association with humans (rather than innate species characteristics) is the single most important determinant of invasiveness in this mosquito.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular markers for antimalarial drug resistance can be used to rapidly monitor the emergence and spatial distribution of resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Little has been done to analyse molecular surveillance efforts or to assess surveillance coverage. This study aimed to develop an evidence map to characterise the spatial-temporal distribution and sampling methodologies of drug resistance surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa, specifically focusing on markers associated with ACT partner drugs. METHODS: By use of a systematic search, we identified studies that reported data on the following mutations associated with ACT partner drug resistance: pfmdr1 Asn86Tyr, Tyr184Phe, Asp1246Tyr, and copy number variation and pfcrt Lys76Thr, with sample collection occurring in sub-Saharan Africa between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2018, corresponding to the uptake of ACTs. For each identified study, we extracted information on its sampling and laboratory methods, author and publication affiliations, years of sampling and of publication, geographic coordinates of the study sites, and prevalence of the partner drug resistance-associated markers. We used linear models to test whether urbanicity, population density, and endemicity were predictors of drug resistance survey sites and linear regressions to identify associations between the number of resistance surveys within a given country and the at-risk malaria population in 2010, the per-capita GDP in 2010, and the mean amount of funding directed to malaria and to determine trends in marker prevalence over time. For country case studies with three or more datapoints, we assessed global spatial autocorrelation using Moran's I. FINDINGS: Our search yielded 254 studies encompassing 492 year-specific and location-specific surveys from 35 malaria-endemic countries, the most complete set of molecular partner drug surveillance data to date. We observed a median time lag of 3·1 years (95\% CI 1·0-7·7) from final sample acquisition to publication. 22 (49\%) of the 44 countries in the study region conducted, on average, one or fewer studies every 3 years. The locations of surveillance sites were positively associated with urbanicity (p{$<$}0·0001), and the abundance of country-level data was associated with reported donor funding in 2004-18 (p=0·0011) and local government funding in 2004-09 (p=0·014). Nearly all molecular markers displayed significant regional trends over time and global spatial autocorrelation in space. For selected countries with more widespread coverage of surveillance data, some markers also displayed spatial heterogeneity. INTERPRETATION: In most sub-Saharan countries, molecular data on antimalarial resistance might not be representative of the temporal and geographic heterogeneity of partner drug resistance, and likely do not represent the true spatially dependent distribution of partner drug resistance. Our results highlight several inefficiencies that can be improved upon to develop more accurate data landscapes, including the expansion of sentinel surveillance systems, syndemic usage of research samples, and increased participation in reporting published and unpublished data to centralised platforms.},

  abstract = {Malaria, one of the greatest historical killers of mankind, continues to claim around half a million lives annually, with almost all deaths occurring in children under the age of five living in tropical Africa. The range of this disease is limited by climate to the warmer regions of the globe, and so anthropogenic global warming (and climate change more broadly) now threatens to alter the geographic area for potential malaria transmission, as both the Plasmodium malaria parasite and Anopheles mosquito vector have highly temperature-dependent lifecycles, while the aquatic immature Anopheles habitats are also strongly dependent upon rainfall and local hydrodynamics. A wide variety of process-based (or mechanistic) mathematical models have thus been proposed for the complex, highly nonlinear weather-driven Anopheles lifecycle and malaria transmission dynamics, but have reached somewhat disparate conclusions as to optimum temperatures for transmission, and the possible effect of increasing temperatures upon (potential) malaria distribution, with some projecting a large increase in the area at risk for malaria, but others predicting primarily a shift in the disease’s geographic range. More generally, both global and local environmental changes drove the initial emergence of P. falciparum as a major human pathogen in tropical Africa some 10,000 years ago, and the disease has a long and deep history through the present. It is the goal of this paper to review major aspects of malaria biology, methods for formalizing these into mathematical forms, uncertainties and controversies in proper modeling methodology, and to provide a timeline of some major modeling efforts from the classical works of Sir Ronald Ross and George Macdonald through recent climate-focused modeling studies. Finally, we attempt to place such mathematical work within a broader historical context for the “million-murdering Death” of malaria.},

They are enhanced by burning of fossil fuels and the emission of huge amounts of CO2 gas which resulted in greenhouse effect. It is expected that the average global temperature will increase with 2-5~°C in the next decades. As a result, the earth will exhibit marked climatic changes characterized by extremer weather events in the coming decades, such as the increase in temperature, rainfall, summertime, droughts, more frequent and stronger tornadoes and hurricanes. Epidemiological disease cycle includes host, pathogen and in certain cases intermediate host/vector. A complex mixture of various environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and humidity) determines the suitable habitat/ecological niche for every vector host. The availability of suitable vectors is a precondition for the emergence of vector-borne pathogens. Climate changes and global warming will have catastrophic effects on human, animal and environmental ecosystems. Pathogens, especially neglected tropical disease agents, are expected to emerge and re-emerge in several countries including Europe and North America. The lives of millions of people especially in developing countries will be at risk in direct and indirect ways. In the present review, the role of climate changes in the spread of infectious agents and their vectors is discussed. Examples of the major emerging viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases are also summarized.},

  abstract = {Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate analysis that reduces the complexity of datasets while preserving data covariance. The outcome can be visualized on colorful scatterplots, ideally with only a minimal loss of information. PCA applications, implemented in well-cited packages like EIGENSOFT and PLINK, are extensively used as the foremost analyses in population genetics and related fields (e.g., animal and plant or medical genetics). PCA outcomes are used to shape study design, identify, and characterize individuals and populations, and draw historical and ethnobiological conclusions on origins, evolution, dispersion, and relatedness. The replicability crisis in science has prompted us to evaluate whether PCA results are reliable, robust, and replicable. We analyzed twelve common test cases using an intuitive color-based model alongside human population data. We demonstrate that PCA results can be artifacts of the data and can be easily manipulated to generate desired outcomes. PCA adjustment also yielded unfavorable outcomes in association studies. PCA results may not be reliable, robust, or replicable as the field assumes. Our findings raise concerns about the validity of results reported in the population genetics literature and related fields that place a disproportionate reliance upon PCA outcomes and the insights derived from them. We conclude that PCA may have a biasing role in genetic investigations and that 32,000-216,000 genetic studies should be reevaluated. An alternative mixed-admixture population genetic model is discussed.},

  abstract = {Autotomy, the self-induced loss of a body part, occurs throughout Animalia. A lizard dropping its tail to escape predation is an iconic example, however, autotomy occurs in a diversity of other organisms. Octopuses can release their arms, crabs can drop their claws, and bugs can amputate their legs. The diversity of organisms that can autotomize body parts has led to a wealth of research and several taxonomically focused reviews. These reviews have played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of autotomy within their respective groups. However, because of their taxonomic focus, these reviews are constrained in their ability to enhance our understanding of autotomy. Here, we aim to synthesize research on the ecology and evolution of autotomy throughout Animalia, building a unified framework on which future studies can expand. We found that the ability to drop an appendage has evolved multiple times throughout Animalia and that once autotomy has evolved, selection appears to act on the removable appendage to increase the efficacy and/or efficiency of autotomy. This could explain why some autotomizable body parts are so elaborate (e.g. brightly coloured). We also show that there are multiple benefits, and variable costs, associated with autotomy. Given this variation, we generate an economic theory of autotomy (modified from the economic theory of escape) which makes predictions about when an individual should resort to autotomy. Finally, we show that the loss of an autotomizable appendage can have numerous consequences on population and community dynamics. By taking this broad taxonomic approach, we identified patterns of autotomy that transcend specific lineages and highlight clear directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Polyploidy is increasingly seen as a driver of both evolutionary innovation and ecological success. One source of polyploid organisms’ successes may be their origins in the merging and mixing of genomes from two different species (e.g., allopolyploidy). Using POInT (the Polyploid Orthology Inference Tool), we model the resolution of three allopolyploidy events, one from the bakers’ yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), one from the thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) and one from grasses including Sorghum bicolor. Analyzing a total of 21 genomes, we assign to every gene a probability for having come from each parental subgenome (i.e., derived from the diploid progenitor species), yielding orthologous segments across all genomes. Our model detects statistically robust evidence for the existence of biased fractionation in all three lineages, whereby genes from one of the two subgenomes were more likely to be lost than those from the other subgenome. We further find that a driver of this pattern of biased losses is the co-retention of genes from the same parental genome that share functional interactions. The pattern of biased fractionation after the Arabidopsis and grass allopolyploid events was surprisingly constant in time, with the same parental genome favored throughout the lineages’ history. In strong contrast, the yeast allopolyploid event shows evidence of biased fractionation only immediately after the event, with balanced gene losses more recently. The rapid loss of functionally associated genes from a single subgenome is difficult to reconcile with the action of genetic drift and suggests that selection may favor the removal of specific duplicates. Coupled to the evidence for continuing, functionally-associated biased fractionation after the A. thaliana At-α event, we suggest that, after allopolyploidy, there are functional conflicts between interacting genes encoded in different subgenomes that are ultimately resolved through preferential duplicate loss.},

We show how the two most widely used approaches to modeling population structure, admixture-based models and principal components analysis (PCA), can be viewed within a single unifying framework of matrix factorization. Specifically, they can both be interpreted as approximating an observed genotype matrix by a product of two lower-rank matrices, but with different constraints or prior distributions on these lower-rank matrices. This opens the door to a large range of possible approaches to analyzing population structure, by considering other constraints or priors. In this paper, we introduce one such novel approach, based on sparse factor analysis (SFA). We investigate the effects of the different types of constraint in several real and simulated data sets. We find that SFA produces similar results to admixture-based models when the samples are descended from a few well-differentiated ancestral populations and can recapitulate the results of PCA when the population structure is more "continuous," as in isolation-by-distance models.},

  abstract = {Population genetics theory is primarily based on mathematical models in which spatial complexity and temporal variability are largely ignored. In contrast, the field of landscape genetics expressly focuses on how population genetic processes are affected by complex spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity. It is spatially explicit and relates patterns to processes by combining complex and realistic life histories, behaviours, landscape features and genetic data. Central to landscape genetics is the connection of spatial patterns of genetic variation to the usually highly stochastic space-time processes that create them over both historical and contemporary time periods. The field should benefit from a shift to computer simulation approaches, which enable incorporation of demographic and environmental stochasticity. A key role of simulations is to show how demographic processes such as dispersal or reproduction interact with landscape features to affect probability of site occupancy, population size, and gene flow, which in turn determine spatial genetic structure. Simulations could also be used to compare various statistical methods and determine which have correct type I error or the highest statistical power to correctly identify spatio-temporal and environmental effects. Simulations may also help in evaluating how specific spatial metrics may be used to project future genetic trends. This article summarizes some of the fundamental aspects of spatial-temporal population genetic processes. It discusses the potential use of simulations to determine how various spatial metrics can be rigorously employed to identify features of interest, including contrasting locus-specific spatial patterns due to micro-scale environmental selection.},

A recent Bayesian algorithm implemented in the software STRUCTURE allows the identification of such groups. However, the ability of this algorithm to detect the true number of clusters (K) in a sample of individuals when patterns of dispersal among populations are not homogeneous has not been tested. The goal of this study is to carry out such tests, using various dispersal scenarios from data generated with an individual-based model. We found that in most cases the estimated 'log probability of data' does not provide a correct estimation of the number of clusters, K. However, using an ad hoc statistic DeltaK based on the rate of change in the log probability of data between successive K values, we found that STRUCTURE accurately detects the uppermost hierarchical level of structure for the scenarios we tested. As might be expected, the results are sensitive to the type of genetic marker used (AFLP vs. microsatellite), the number of loci scored, the number of populations sampled, and the number of individuals typed in each sample.},

  abstract = {The upland peatlands of the UK are severely eroded, with large areas affected by gully erosion. The peatlands are important areas of carbon storage and provide a range of other ecosystem services including water supply and biodiversity all of which are negatively impacted by erosion of the upland surface. The magnitude of the gully erosion, and consequent adjustment of the peatland morphology, is such that in degraded peatlands the extent and magnitude of erosion is a major control on peatland function. Accurate mapping of gully form is therefore a necessary precondition to the understanding and management of these systems. This paper develops an approach to extracting gully maps from high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). Gully maps of the Bleaklow Plateau in northern England were derived from a 2 m LiDAR DEM by combining areas of low difference from mean elevation and high positive plan curvature. Gully depth was modelled by interpolating between gully edges. Testing of the gully mapping and depth modelling against aerial photography, manual interpretation of the DEM and ground survey revealed that gully plan form is well represented and gully width and depth are modelled with tolerances close to the horizontal and vertical resolution of the LiDAR imagery. Estimates of gully width and depth were less reliable for gullies with total width of less than four pixels. The approach allows for the first time the derivation of accurate estimates of gully extent and magnitude over large areas and provides the basis for modelling a range of processes controlled by gullying. The approach has wider applicability to mapping gully erosion in a wide range of environments. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin of chromosomal regions, and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows identification of subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using the existing method.

However, application to practical problems requires choices among computational tools to balance statistical rigor, computational complexity, sensitivity to sampling strategy and interpretability. METHODS: We introduce a fast, heuristic algorithm to reconstruct partially-observed transmission networks (POTN) that combines features of phylogenetic and transmission tree approaches. We compare the transmission network generated by POTN with existing algorithms (BEAST and SeqTrack), and discuss the benefits and challenges of phylogeographic analysis on examples of epidemic and endemic diseases: Ebola virus, H1N1 pandemic influenza and polio. RESULTS: For the 2014 Sierra Leone Ebola virus outbreak and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, all three methods provide similarly plausible transmission histories but differ in detail. For polio in northern Nigeria, we discuss performance trade-offs between the POTN and discrete phylogeography in BEAST and conclude that spatial history reconstruction is limited by under-sampling. CONCLUSIONS: POTN is complementary to available tools on densely-sampled data, fails gracefully on under-sampled data and is scalable to accommodate larger datasets. We provide further evidence for the utility of phylogeography for understanding transmission networks of rapidly evolving epidemics. We propose simple heuristic criteria to identify how sampling rates and disease dynamics interact to determine fundamental limitations of phylogeographic inference.},

However, little has been reported regarding loss of sensitivity due to field methodology. Therefore, studies were carried out in relation to blood sampling (anticoagulants, culture medium, filter paper), storage (temperature, time and immediate lysis) and handling (repeated thawing and freezing). The PCR was unaffected by citrate and EDTA but partly inhibited by heparin (inhibition was reversed by heparinase at optimal concentrations). Samples collected on filter paper showed a significant 100-fold lower sensitivity (compared to control samples frozen immediately after collection) when stored at 30 degrees C and 60\% humidity; and the paper quality appeared to be critical. Storage of unprocessed whole blood at 4 degrees C, 20 degrees C or 30 degrees C rarely resulted in any loss of sensitivity. Repeated thawing generally resulted in 10-fold loss of sensitivity compared to blood kept frozen until DNA extraction. The presence of antimalarial drug did not apparently affect sensitivity. We conclude that the mode of collection and storage of blood samples may influence the sensitivity of detection of malaria parasites by PCR. This may be critical in studies including individuals with low parasitaemia, mixed infections and comparison of data from different settings.},

We produced a global, 30-m-resolution inland surface water dataset with an automated algorithm using Landsat-based surface reflectance estimates, multispectral water and vegetation indices, terrain metrics, and prior coarse-resolution water masks. The dataset identified 3,650,723 km2 of inland water globally – nearly three quarters of which was located in North America (40.65\%) and Asia (32.77\%), followed by Europe (9.64\%), Africa (8.47\%), South America (6.91\%), and Oceania (1.57\%). Boreal forests contained the largest portion of terrestrial surface water (25.03\% of the global total), followed by the nominal ‘inland water’ biome (16.36\%), tundra (15.67\%), and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests (13.91\%).

  abstract = {Character state live phylogeny generalizes character state phylogeny in the sense that they relate taxonomic units based on their similarities over a set of characters, but allowing live ancestors. An approach for character state live phylogeny reconstruction is called parsimony, where one tries to minimize the total number of character state changes along the edges of the tree. The problem of finding a tree that minimizes this number is known as large live parsimony problem. When the tree topology is also given as input, the problem is known as small live parsimony problem. We propose a genetic algorithm to solve the large live problem, which uses extended versions of the algorithms of Fitch and Sankoff to solve the small live problem, both devised in this work. Besides, we performed two experiments. In the first one, a multiple alignment of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses from different countries, taken as input, allowed to obtain interesting live phylogenies, representing alternative evolutionary hypothesis. The second experiment took as input a multiple alignment of the HIV virus env gene, from one patient, read in different dates through 12 years. The generated live phylogenies were similar to the ones generated by PAUP, where dates close to each other were grouped into clusters, but suggesting new evolutionary stories.},

We analyzed the responses to explore the interplay between various scholarly metrics and hiring outcomes. We concluded that, above a certain threshold, the benchmarks traditionally used to measure research success - including funding, number of publications or journals published in - were unable to completely differentiate applicants with and without job offers. Respondents also reported that the hiring process was unnecessarily stressful, time-consuming, and lacking in feedback, irrespective of outcome. Our findings suggest that there is considerable scope to improve the transparency of the hiring process.},

This study aims to describe important methodological aspects and specificities of geospatial approaches applied to RMNCH coverage and impact outcomes and enable non-specialist readers to critically evaluate and interpret these studies. METHODS: Two independent searches were carried out using Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, SCIELO and LILACS electronic databases. Studies based on survey data using geospatial approaches on RMNCH in LMICs were considered eligible. Studies whose outcomes were not measures of occurrence were excluded. RESULTS: We identified 82 studies focused on over 30 different RMNCH outcomes. Bayesian hierarchical models were the predominant modeling approach found in 62 studies. 5\,×\,5~km estimates were the most common resolution and the main source of information was Demographic and Health Surveys. Model validation was under reported, with the out-of-sample method being reported in only 56\% of the studies and 13\% of the studies did not present a single validation metric. Uncertainty assessment and reporting lacked standardization, and more than a quarter of the studies failed to report any uncertainty measure. CONCLUSIONS: The field of geospatial estimation focused on RMNCH outcomes is clearly expanding. However, despite the adoption of a standardized conceptual modeling framework for generating finer spatial scale estimates, methodological aspects such as model validation and uncertainty demand further attention as they are both essential in assisting the reader to evaluate the estimates that are being presented.},

  abstract = {Classifying surface cover types and analyzing changes are among the most common applications of remote sensing. One of the most basic classification tasks is to distinguish water bodies from dry land surfaces. Landsat imagery is among the most widely used sources of data in remote sensing of water resources; and although several techniques of surface water extraction using Landsat data are described in the literature, their application is constrained by low accuracy in various situations. Besides, with the use of techniques such as single band thresholding and two-band indices, identifying an appropriate threshold yielding the highest possible accuracy is a challenging and time consuming task, as threshold values vary with location and time of image acquisition. The purpose of this study was therefore to devise an index that consistently improves water extraction accuracy in the presence of various sorts of environmental noise and at the same time offers a stable threshold value. Thus we introduced a new Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) improving classification accuracy in areas that include shadow and dark surfaces that other classification methods often fail to classify correctly. We tested the accuracy and robustness of the new method using Landsat 5 TM images of several water bodies in Denmark, Switzerland, Ethiopia, South Africa and New Zealand. Kappa coefficient, omission and commission errors were calculated to evaluate accuracies. The performance of the classifier was compared with that of the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) classifiers. In four out of five test sites, classification accuracy of AWEI was significantly higher than that of MNDWI and ML (P-value{$<$}. 0.01). AWEI improved accuracy by lessening commission and omission errors by 50\% compared to those resulting from MNDWI and about 25\% compared to ML classifiers. Besides, the new method was shown to have a fairly stable optimal threshold value. Therefore, AWEI can be used for extracting water with high accuracy, especially in mountainous areas where deep shadow caused by the terrain is an important source of classification error. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the most life-threatening vector-borne diseases globally. Recent autochthonous cases registered in several European countries have raised awareness regarding the threat of malaria reintroduction to Europe. An increasing number of imported malaria cases today occur due to international travel and migrant flows from malaria-endemic countries. The cumulative factors of the presence of competent vectors, favourable climatic conditions and evidence of increasing temperatures might lead to the re-emergence of malaria in countries where the infection was previously eliminated. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines. We searched for original articles focusing on rising temperature and the receptivity to malaria transmission in Europe. We evaluated the quality of the selected studies using a standardised tool. RESULTS: The search resulted in 1'999 articles of possible relevance and after screening we included 10 original research papers in the quantitative analysis for the systematic review. With further increasing temperatures studies predicted a northward spread of the occurrence of Anopheles mosquitoes and an extension of seasonality, enabling malaria transmission for annual periods up to 6 months in the years 2051-2080. Highest vector stability and receptivity were predicted in Southern and South-Eastern European areas. Anopheles atroparvus, the main potential malaria vector in Europe, might play an important role under changing conditions favouring malaria transmission. CONCLUSION: The receptivity of Europe for malaria transmission will increase as a result of rising temperature unless socioeconomic factors remain favourable and appropriate public health measures are implemented. Our systematic review serves as an evidence base for future preventive measures.},

Since then, their program FDIST2 and a user-friendly program optimized for large datasets, LOSITAN, have been used widely in the population genetics literature, often without the requisite number of samples. We observed empirical datasets whose distributions could not be reconciled with the confidence intervals generated by the null coalescent island model. Here, we use forward-in-time simulations to investigate circumstances under which the FST-heterozygosity outlier approach performs poorly for next-generation single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets. Our results show that samples involving few independent populations, particularly when migration rates are low, result in distributions of the FST-heterozygosity relationship that are not described by the null model implemented in LOSITAN. In addition, even under favorable conditions LOSITAN rarely provides confidence intervals that precisely fit SNP data, making the associated P-values only roughly valid at best. We present an alternative method, implemented in a new R package named fsthet, which uses the raw empirical data to generate smoothed outlier plots for the FST-heterozygosity relationship.},

  abstract = {Large-scale estimates of the area of terrestrial surface waters have greatly improved over time, in particular through the development of multi-satellite methodologies, but the generally coarse spatial resolution (tens of kms) of global observations is still inadequate for many ecological applications. The goal of this study is to introduce a new, globally applicable downscaling method and to demonstrate its applicability to derive fine resolution results from coarse global inundation estimates. The downscaling procedure predicts the location of surface water cover with an inundation probability map that was generated by bagged decision trees using globally available topographic and hydrographic information from the SRTM-derived HydroSHEDS database and trained on the wetland extent of the GLC2000 global land cover map. We applied the downscaling technique to the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) dataset to produce a new high-resolution inundation map at a pixel size of 15 arc-seconds, termed GIEMS-D15. GIEMS-D15 represents three states of land surface inundation extents: mean annual minimum (total area, 6.5×106km2), mean annual maximum (12.1×106km2), and long-term maximum (17.3×106km2); the latter depicts the largest surface water area of any global map to date. While the accuracy of GIEMS-D15 reflects distribution errors introduced by the downscaling process as well as errors from the original satellite estimates, overall accuracy is good yet spatially variable. A comparison against regional wetland cover maps generated by independent observations shows that the results adequately represent large floodplains and wetlands. GIEMS-D15 offers a higher resolution delineation of inundated areas than previously available for the assessment of global freshwater resources and the study of large floodplain and wetland ecosystems. The technique of applying inundation probabilities also allows for coupling with coarse-scale hydro-climatological model simulations.},

This study aimed to determine the complexity of infection and genetic diversity of P. vivax and P. falciparum throughout Papua New Guinea (PNG) to evaluate transmission dynamics across the country. In 2008-2009, a nationwide malaria indicator survey collected 8,936 samples from all 16 endemic provinces of PNG. Of these, 892 positive P. vivax samples were genotyped at PvMS16 and PvmspF3, and 758 positive P. falciparum samples were genotyped at Pfmsp2. The data were analyzed for multiplicity of infection (MOI) and genetic diversity. Overall, P. vivax had higher polyclonality (71\%) and mean MOI (2.32) than P. falciparum (20\%, 1.39). These measures were significantly associated with prevalence for P. falciparum but not for P. vivax. The genetic diversity of P. vivax (PvMS16: expected heterozygosity = 0.95, 0.85-0.98; PvMsp1F3: 0.78, 0.66-0.89) was higher and less variable than that of P. falciparum (Pfmsp2: 0.89, 0.65-0.97). Significant associations of MOI with allelic richness (rho = 0.69, P = 0.009) and expected heterozygosity (rho = 0.87, P {$<$} 0.001) were observed for P. falciparum. Conversely, genetic diversity was not correlated with polyclonality nor mean MOI for P. vivax. The results demonstrate higher complexity of infection and genetic diversity of P. vivax across the country. Although P. falciparum shows a strong association of these parameters with prevalence, a lack of association was observed for P. vivax and is consistent with higher potential for outcrossing of this species.},

These areas are a key resource for traditional land management at high altitude. Because they retain water in the upper basins of the cordillera, they are important sources of water and forage for domesticated livestock as well as biodiversity hotspots. This article is based on more than six years' work on bofedales in several regions of Peru. The concept of bofedal is introduced, the typical plant communities are identified and the associated wild mammals, birds and amphibians are described. Also, the most recent studies of peat and carbon storage in bofedales are reviewed. Traditional land use since prehispanic times has involved the management of water and livestock, both of which are essential for maintenance of these ecosystems. The status of bofedales in Peruvian legislation and their representation in natural protected areas and Ramsar sites is outlined. Finally, the main threats to their conservation (overgrazing, peat extraction, mining and development of infrastructure) are identified.},

Despite substantial advances, analytical tools that could potentially address the challenges posed by increased model complexity have not been fully explored. For example, deep learning techniques are underutilized for phylogeographic model selection. In non-model organisms, the lack of information about their ecology and evolution can lead to uncertainty about which demographic models are appropriate. Here, we assess the utility of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for assessing demographic models in South American lizards in the genus Norops. Three demographic scenarios (constant, expansion, and bottleneck) were considered for each of four inferred population-level lineages, and we found that the overall model accuracy was higher than 98\% for all lineages. We then evaluated a set of 26 models that accounted for evolutionary relationships, gene flow, and changes in effective population size among the four lineages, identifying a single model with an estimated overall accuracy of 87\% when using CNNs. The inferred demography of the lizard system suggests that gene flow between non-sister populations and changes in effective population sizes through time, probably in response to Pleistocene climatic oscillations, have shaped genetic diversity in this system. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) was applied to provide a comparison to the performance of CNNs. ABC was unable to identify a single model among the larger set of 26 models in the subsequent analysis. Our results demonstrate that CNNs can be easily and usefully incorporated into the phylogeographer's toolkit.},

  abstract = {Resistance in malaria is a growing concern affecting many areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Since the emergence of artemisinin resistance in the late 2000s in Cambodia, research into the underlying mechanisms has been underway. The 2019 Malaria Challenge posited the task of developing computational models that address important problems in advancing the fight against malaria. The first goal was to accurately predict artemisinin drug resistance levels of Plasmodium falciparum isolates, as quantified by the IC50. The second goal was to predict the parasite clearance rate of malaria parasite isolates based on in vitro transcriptional profiles. In this work, we develop machine learning models using novel methods for transforming isolate data and handling the tens of thousands of variables that result from these data transformation exercises. This is demonstrated by using massively parallel processing of the data vectorization for use in scalable machine learning. In addition, we show the utility of ensemble machine learning modeling for highly effective predictions of both goals of this challenge. This is demonstrated by the use of multiple machine learning algorithms combined with various scaling and normalization preprocessing steps.

  abstract = {The unique biological features of Plasmodium vivax not only make it difficult to control but also to eliminate. For the transmission of the malaria parasite from infected human to the vector, gametocytes play a major role. The transmission potential of a malarial infection is inferred based on microscopic detection of gametocytes and molecular screening of genes in the female gametocytes. Microscopy-based detection methods could grossly underestimate the reservoirs of infection as gametocytes may occur as submicroscopic or as micro- or macro-gametocytes. The identification of genes that are highly expressed and polymorphic in male and female gametocytes is critical for monitoring changes not only in their relative proportions but also the composition of gametocyte clones contributing to transmission over time. Recent transcriptomic study revealed two distinct clusters of highly correlated genes expressed in the P. vivax gametocytes, indicating that the male and female terminal gametocytogeneses are independently regulated. However, the detective power of these genes is unclear. In this study, we compared genetic variations of 15 and 11 genes expressed, respectively, in the female and male gametocytes among P. vivax isolates from Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America. Further, we constructed phylogenetic trees to determine the resolution power and clustering patterns of gametocyte clones. As expected, Pvs25 (PVP01\_0616100) and Pvs16 (PVP01\_0305600) expressed in the female gametocytes were highly conserved in all geographical isolates. In contrast, genes including 6-cysteine protein Pvs230 (PVP01\_0415800) and upregulated in late gametocytes ULG8 (PVP01\_1452800) expressed in the female gametocytes, as well as two CPW-WPC family proteins (PVP01\_1215900 and PVP01\_1320100) expressed in the male gametocytes indicated considerably high nucleotide and haplotype diversity among isolates. Parasite samples expressed in male and female gametocyte genes were observed in separate phylogenetic clusters and likely represented distinct gametocyte clones. Compared to Pvs25, Pvs230 (PVP01\_0415800) and a CPW-WPC family protein (PVP01\_0904300) showed higher expression in a subset of Ethiopian P. vivax samples. Thus, Pvs230, ULG8, and CPW-WPC family proteins including PVP01\_0904300, PVP01\_1215900, and PVP01\_1320100 could potentially be used as novel biomarkers for detecting both sexes of P. vivax gametocytes in low-density infections and estimating transmission reservoirs.},

Previously, simplistic regression-based models have been created to characterize malaria infections, though these models often only include a couple genetic factors. Specifically, the Baker et al., 2005 model uses two types of particular repeats in histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) to assert P. falciparum infection, though the efficacy of this model has waned over recent years due to genetic mutations in the parasite. In this work, we use a dataset of 406 P. falciparum PfHRP2 genetic sequences collected in Ethiopia and derived a larger set of motif repeat matches for use in generating a series of diagnostic machine learning models. Here we show that the usage of additional and different motif repeats proves effective in predicting infection. Furthermore, we use machine learning model explanability methods to highlight which of the repeat types are most important, thereby suggesting potential targets for future versions of rapid diagnostic tests.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Plasmodium vivax malaria is much less common in Africa than the rest of the world because the parasite relies primarily on the Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor (DARC) to invade human erythrocytes, and the majority of Africans are Duffy negative. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the reporting of P. vivax cases in Africa, with a high number of them being in Duffy negative individuals, potentially indicating P. vivax has evolved an alternative invasion mechanism that can overcome Duffy negativity. Here, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and copy number variation (CNV) in Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) data from 44 P. vivax samples isolated from symptomatic malaria patients in southwestern Ethiopia, where both Duffy positive and Duffy negative individuals are found. A total of 123,711 SNPs were detected, of which 22.7\% were nonsynonymous and 77.3\% were synonymous mutations. The largest number of SNPs were detected on chromosomes 9 (24,007 SNPs; 19.4\% of total) and 10 (16,852 SNPs, 13.6\% of total). There were particularly high levels of polymorphism in erythrocyte binding gene candidates including merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) and merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3.5, MSP3.85 and MSP3.9). Two genes, MAEBL and MSP3.8 related to immunogenicity and erythrocyte binding function were detected with significant signals of positive selection. Variation in gene copy number was also concentrated in genes involved in host-parasite interactions, including the expansion of the Duffy binding protein gene (PvDBP) on chromosome 6 and MSP3.11 on chromosome 10. Based on the phylogeny constructed from the whole genome sequences, the expansion of these genes was an independent process among the P. vivax lineages in Ethiopia. We further inferred transmission patterns of P. vivax infections among study sites and showed various levels of gene flow at a small geographical scale. The genomic features of P. vivax provided baseline data for future comparison with those in Duffy-negative individuals and allowed us to develop a panel of informative Single Nucleotide Polymorphic markers diagnostic at a micro-geographical scale.},

There is growing awareness that it is necessary to incorporate multi-host and/or multi-parasite interactions to understand and predict current and future disease threats better, and new tools are needed to help address this task. Eco-phylogenetics (phylogenetic community ecology) provides one avenue for exploring multi-host multi-parasite systems, yet the incorporation of eco-phylogenetic concepts and methods into studies of host pathogen dynamics has lagged behind. Eco-phylogenetics is a transformative approach that uses evolutionary history to infer present-day dynamics. Here, we present an eco-phylogenetic framework to reveal insights into parasite communities and infectious disease dynamics across spatial and temporal scales. We illustrate how eco-phylogenetic methods can help untangle the mechanisms of host-parasite dynamics from individual (e.g. co-infection) to landscape scales (e.g. parasite/host community structure). An improved ecological understanding of multi-host and multi-pathogen dynamics across scales will increase our ability to predict disease threats.},

MrIML provides a powerful and interpretable framework that enables users to harness recent advances in machine learning to quantify multilocus genomic relationships, to identify loci of interest for future landscape genetics studies, and to gain new insights into adaptation across environmental gradients. Relationships between genetic variation and environment are often nonlinear and interactive; these characteristics have been challenging to address using traditional landscape genetic approaches. Our package helps capture this complexity and offers functions that fit and interpret a wide range of highly flexible models that are routinely used for single-locus landscape genetics studies but are rarely extended to estimate response functions for multiple loci. To demonstrate the package's broad functionality, we test its ability to recover landscape relationships from simulated genomic data. We also apply the package to two empirical case studies. In the first, we model genetic variation of North American balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera, Salicaceae) populations across environmental gradients. In the second case study, we recover the landscape and host drivers of feline immunodeficiency virus genetic variation in bobcats (Lynx rufus). The ability to model thousands of loci collectively and compare models from linear regression to extreme gradient boosting, within the same analytical framework, has the potential to be transformative. The MrIML framework is also extendable and not limited to modelling genetic variation; for example, it can quantify the environmental drivers of microbiomes and coinfection dynamics.},

We found that the urban landscape played a significant role in shaping FIV transmission. Even though bobcats were often trapped within the urban matrix, FIV transmission events were more likely to occur in areas with more natural habitat elements. Urban fragmentation also resulted in lower rates of pathogen evolution, possibly owing to a narrower range of host genotypes in the fragmented area. Combined, our findings show that urban landscapes can have impacts on a pathogen and its evolution in a carnivore living in one of the most fragmented and urban systems in North America. The analytical approach used here can be broadly applied to other host-pathogen systems, including humans.},

Landscape genetics combines landscape and genetic data to address this issue, with the main objective of disentangling direct and indirect relationships among an intricate set of variables. Causal modeling has strong potential to address the complex nature of landscape genetic data sets. However, this statistical approach was not initially developed to address the pairwise distance matrices commonly used in landscape genetics. Here, we aimed to extend the applicability of two causal modeling methods-that is, maximum-likelihood path analysis and the directional separation test-by developing statistical approaches aimed at handling distance matrices and improving functional connectivity inference. Using simulations, we showed that these approaches greatly improved the robustness of the absolute (using a frequentist approach) and relative (using an information-theoretic approach) fits of the tested models. We used an empirical data set combining genetic information on a freshwater fish species (Gobio occitaniae) and detailed landscape descriptors to demonstrate the usefulness of causal modeling to identify functional connectivity in wild populations. Specifically, we demonstrated how direct and indirect relationships involving altitude, temperature, and oxygen concentration influenced within- and between-population genetic diversity of G. occitaniae.},

Route selection is therefore the process of resolving the conflict between population at risk and efficiency considerations. To assist in resolving this conflict, a working spatial decision support system (SDSS) called Hazmat Path is developed. The proposed hazmat routing SDSS overcomes three significant challenges, namely handling a realistic network, offering sophisticated route generating heuristics and functioning on a desktop personal computer. The paper discusses creative approaches to data manipulation, data and solution visualization, user interfaces, and optimization heuristics implemented in Hazmat Path to meet these challenges.},

  abstract = {1 Spatially explicit Bayesian clustering techniques offer a powerful tool for ecology and wildlife management, as genetic divisions can be correlated with landscape features. We used these methods to analyse the genetic structure of a population of European wild boar Sus scrofa with the aim of identifying effective barriers for disease management units. However, it has been suggested that the methods could produce biased results when faced with deviations from random mating not caused by genetic discontinuities, such as isolation by distance (IBD). 2 We analysed a data set consisting of 697 wild boar multilocus genotypes using spatially explicit (baps, geneland) and non-explicit (structure) Bayesian methods. We also simulated and analysed data sets characterized by different degrees of IBD, with and without genetic discontinuities. 3 When analysing the empirical data set, different programs did not converge on the same clustering solution and some clusters were difficult to explain biologically. Results from the simulated data showed that IBD, also present in the empirical data set, could cause the Bayesian methods to overestimate genetic structure. Simulated barriers were identified correctly, but the programs superimposed further clusters at higher IBD levels . 4 It was not possible to ascertain with confidence whether the clustering solutions offered by the various programs were an accurate reflection of population genetic structure in our empirical data set or were artefacts created by the underlying IBD pattern. 5 Synthesis and applications: We show that Bayesian clustering methods can overestimate genetic structure when analysing an individual-based data set characterized by isolation by distance. This bias could lead to the erroneous delimitation of management or conservation units. Investigators should be critical and suspicious of clusters that cannot be explained biologically. Data sets should be tested for isolation by distance and conclusions should not be based on the output from just one method.},

Ecological association studies can provide lists of genetic polymorphisms that are potentially involved in local adaptation to environmental conditions through natural selection. Here, we present the R package LEA that enables users to run ecological association studies from the R command line. The package can perform analyses of population structure and genome scans for adaptive alleles from large genomic data sets. It derives advantages from R programming functionalities to adjust significance values for multiple testing issues and to visualize results. This note also illustrates the main steps of ecological association studies and the typical use of LEA for analysing data sets based on R commands.},

  abstract = {Until recently, advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) observations were the only viable source of data for global land cover mapping. While many useful insights have been gained from analyses based on AVHRR data, the availability of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with greatly improved spectral, spatial, geometric, and radiometric attributes provides significant new opportunities and challenges for remote sensing-based land cover mapping research. In this paper, we describe the algorithms and databases being used to produce the MODIS global land cover product. This product provides maps of global land cover at 1-km spatial resolution using several classification systems, principally that of the IGBP. To generate these maps, a supervised classification methodology is used that exploits a global database of training sites interpreted from high-resolution imagery in association with ancillary data. In addition to the IGBP class at each pixel, the MODIS land cover product provides several other parameters including estimates for the classification confidence associated with the IGBP label, a prediction for the most likely alternative class, and class labels for several other classification schemes that are used by the global modeling community. Initial results based on 5 months of MODIS data are encouraging. At global scales, the distribution of vegetation and land cover types is qualitatively realistic. At regional scales, comparisons among heritage AVHRR products, Landsat TM data, and results from MODIS show that the algorithm is performing well. As a longer time series of data is added to the processing stream and the representation of global land cover in the site database is refined, the quality of the MODIS land cover product will improve accordingly.

In the past decade, data sources and methodologies for creating global land cover maps from remote sensing have evolved rapidly. Here we describe the datasets and algorithms used to create the Collection 5 MODIS Global Land Cover Type product, which is substantially changed relative to Collection 4. In addition to using updated input data, the algorithm and ancillary datasets used to produce the product have been refined. Most importantly, the Collection 5 product is generated at 500-m spatial resolution, providing a four-fold increase in spatial resolution relative to the previous version. In addition, many components of the classification algorithm have been changed. The training site database has been revised, land surface temperature is now included as an input feature. and ancillary datasets used in post-processing of ensemble decision tree results have been updated. Further, methods used to correct classifier results for bias imposed by training data properties have been refined, techniques used to fuse ancillary data based on spatially varying prior probabilities have been revised, and a variety of methods have been developed to address limitations of the algorithm for the urban, wetland, and deciduous needleleaf classes. Finally, techniques used to stabilize classification results across years have been developed and implemented to reduce year-to-year variation in land cover labels not associated with land cover change. Results from a cross-validation analysis indicate that the overall accuracy of the product is about 75\% correctly classified, but that the range in class-specific accuracies is large. Comparison of Collection 5 maps with Collection 4 results show substantial differences arising from increased spatial resolution and changes in the input data and classification algorithm.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is the most widely distributed human malaria parasite with 2.9 billion people living in endemic areas. Despite intensive malaria control efforts, the proportion of cases attributed to P. vivax is increasing in many countries. Genetic analyses of the parasite population and its dynamics could provide an assessment of the efficacy of control efforts, but, unfortunately, these studies are limited in P. vivax by the lack of informative markers and high-throughput genotyping methods. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a sequencing-based assay to simultaneously genotype more than 100 SNPs and applied this approach to \textasciitilde 500 P. vivax-infected individuals recruited across nine locations in Cambodia between 2004 and 2013. Our analyses showed that the vast majority of infections are polyclonal (92\%) and that P. vivax displays high genetic diversity in Cambodia without apparent geographic stratification. Interestingly, our analyses also revealed that the proportion of monoclonal infections significantly increased between 2004 and 2013, possibly suggesting that malaria control strategies in Cambodia may be successfully affecting the parasite population. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings demonstrate that this high-throughput genotyping assay is efficient in characterizing P. vivax diversity and can provide valuable insights to assess the efficacy of malaria elimination programs or to monitor the spread of specific parasites.},

First it compares the remotely sensed Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB), 1990, with the UK Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000). Then it considers the more general circumstances where users compare any two thematic maps incorporating independent inaccuracies, to record changes. The paper concludes that the measurement of small to medium scale changes over large areas requires levels of precision in mapping which are near impossible to achieve with satellite image classifications alone; indeed they may be difficult to achieve in any form of survey unless it is tailor-made and rigorously applied specifically to the recording of real changes. The paper argues that users of all such data products therefore need to treat with extreme caution their maps of differences and their conclusions about change. It suggests that users need also to develop intelligent approaches, which draw upon a broader knowledge of the directions, patterns and scale of the changes to be recorded, in order to refine their assessments. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we review our current knowledge on the determinants leading to Plasmodium falciparum symptomless infections.

Using simulated genetic data, we show that our MEMGENE method can recover patterns reflecting the landscape features that influenced gene flow.

We developed the MEMGENE package for R in order to detect and visualize relatively weak or cryptic spatial genetic patterns and aid researchers in generating hypotheses about the ecological processes that may underlie these patterns.

  abstract = {The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 μm and a near-IR channel around 0.86 μm. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as (ϱ(0.86 μm) − ϱ(1.24 μm))(ϱ(0.86 μm) + ϱ(1.24 μm)), where ϱ represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-μm and the 1.24-μm channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 μm is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 μm is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86–1.24 μm region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24-μm channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 μm, NDWI should be considered as an independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance spectra of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given.},

Genes involved in antigenic variation are concentrated in the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes. Compared to the genomes of free-living eukaryotic microbes, the genome of this intracellular parasite encodes fewer enzymes and transporters, but a large proportion of genes are devoted to immune evasion and host-parasite interactions. Many nuclear-encoded proteins are targeted to the apicoplast, an organelle involved in fatty-acid and isoprenoid metabolism.

Complex structural variants tend to arise in regions of high repetitiveness and low complexity, challenging both de novo assembly, in which short reads do not capture the long-range context required for resolution, and mapping approaches, in which improper alignment of reads to a reference genome that is highly diverged from that of the sample can lead to false or partial calls. Long-read technologies can potentially solve such problems but are currently unfeasible to use at scale. Here we present Corticall, a graph-based method that combines the advantages of multiple technologies and prior data sources to detect arbitrary classes of genetic variant. We construct multisample, colored de Bruijn graphs from short-read data for all samples, align long-read-derived haplotypes and multiple reference data sources to restore graph connectivity information, and call variants using graph path-finding algorithms and a model for simultaneous alignment and recombination. We validate and evaluate the approach using extensive simulations and use it to characterize the rate and spectrum of de novo mutation events in 119 progeny from four Plasmodium falciparum experimental crosses, using long-read data on the parents to inform reconstructions of the progeny and to detect several known and novel nonallelic homologous recombination events.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews a number of methods for the exploration and modelling of spatial point patterns with particular reference to geographical epidemiology (the geographical incidence of disease). Such methods go well beyond the conventional 'nearest-neighbour' and 'quadrat' analyses which have little to offer in an epidemiological context because they fail to allow for spatial variation in population density. Correction for this is essential if the aim is to assess the evidence for 'clustering' of cases of disease. We examine methods for exploring spatial variation in disease risk, spatial and space-time clustering, and we consider methods for modelling the raised incidence of disease around suspected point sources of pollution. All methods are illustrated by reference to recent case studies including child cancer incidence, Burkitt's lymphoma, cancer of the larynx and childhood asthma. An Appendix considers a range of possible software environments within which to apply these methods. The links to modern geographical information systems are discussed.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries. METHODS: GBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution. FINDINGS: Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990-2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0-9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10-24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10-24 years were also in the top ten in the 25-49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50-74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI. INTERPRETATION: As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.

  abstract = {An essential step toward reconstructing pathogen transmission and answering epidemiologically relevant questions from genomic data is obtaining pairwise genetic distance between infections. For recombining organisms such as malaria parasites, relatedness measures quantifying recent shared ancestry would provide a meaningful distance, suggesting methods based on identity by descent (IBD). While the concept of relatedness and consequently an IBD approach is fairly straightforward for individual parasites, the distance between polyclonal infections, which are prevalent in malaria, presents specific challenges, and awaits a general solution that could be applied to infections of any clonality and accommodate multiallelic (e.g. microsatellite or microhaplotype) and biallelic [single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)] data. Filling this methodological gap, we present Dcifer (Distance for complex infections: fast estimation of relatedness), a method for calculating genetic distance between polyclonal infections, which is designed for unphased data, explicitly accounts for population allele frequencies and complexity of infection, and provides reliable inference. Dcifer's IBD-based framework allows us to define model parameters that represent interhost relatedness and to propose corresponding estimators with attractive statistical properties. By using combinatorics to account for unobserved phased haplotypes, Dcifer is able to quickly process large datasets and estimate pairwise relatedness along with measures of uncertainty. We show that Dcifer delivers accurate and interpretable results and detects related infections with statistical power that is 2-4 times greater than that of approaches based on identity by state. Applications to real data indicate that relatedness structure aligns with geographic locations. Dcifer is implemented in a comprehensive publicly available software package.},

  abstract = {Crop monitoring using remotely sensed image data provides valuable input for a large variety of applications in environmental and agricultural research. However, method development for discrimination between spectrally highly similar crop species remains a challenge in remote sensing. Calculation of vegetation indices is a frequently applied option to amplify the most distinctive parts of a spectrum. Since no vegetation index exist, that is universally best-performing, a method is presented that finds an index that is optimized for the classification of a specific satellite data set to separate two cereal crop types. The η2 (eta-squared) measure of association – presented as novel spectral separability indicator – was used for the evaluation of the numerous tested indices. The approach is first applied on a RapidEye satellite image for the separation of winter wheat and winter barley in a Central German test site. The determined optimized index allows a more accurate classification (97\%) than several well-established vegetation indices like NDVI and EVI ({$<$}87\%). Furthermore, the approach was applied on a RapidEye multi-spectral image time series covering the years 2010–2014. The optimized index for the spectral separation of winter barley and winter wheat for each acquisition date was calculated and its ability to distinct the two classes was assessed. The results indicate that the calculated optimized indices perform better than the standard indices for most seasonal parts of the time series. The red edge spectral region proved to be of high significance for crop classification. Additionally, a time frame of best spectral separability of wheat and barley could be detected in early to mid-summer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: P. vivax is an important public health burden in Ethiopia, accounting for almost half of all malaria cases. Owing to heterogeneous transmission across the country, a stronger evidence base on local transmission dynamics is needed to optimise allocation of resources and improve malaria interventions. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a pilot evaluation of local level P. vivax molecular surveillance in southern Ethiopia, the diversity and population structure of isolates collected between May and November 2013 were investigated. Blood samples were collected from microscopy positive P. vivax patients recruited to clinical and cross-sectional surveys from four sites: Arbaminch, Halaba, Badawacho and Hawassa. Parasite genotyping was undertaken at nine tandem repeat markers. Eight loci were successfully genotyped in 197 samples (between 36 and 59 per site). Heterogeneity was observed in parasite diversity and structure amongst the sites. Badawacho displayed evidence of unstable transmission, with clusters of identical clonal infections. Linkage disequilibrium in Badawacho was higher (IAS = 0.32, P = 0.010) than in the other populations (IAS range = 0.01-0.02) and declined markedly after adjusting for identical infections (IAS = 0.06, P = 0.010). Other than Badawacho (HE = 0.70), population diversity was equivalently high across the sites (HE = 0.83). Polyclonal infections were more frequent in Hawassa (67\%) than the other populations (range: 8-44\%). Despite the variable diversity, differentiation between the sites was low (FST range: 5 x 10-3-0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Marked variation in parasite population structure likely reflects differing local transmission dynamics. Parasite genotyping in these heterogeneous settings has potential to provide important complementary information with which to optimise malaria control interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Temperature is a key determinant of environmental suitability for transmission of human malaria, modulating endemicity in some regions and preventing transmission in others. The spatial modelling of malaria endemicity has become increasingly sophisticated and is now central to the global scale planning, implementation, and monitoring of disease control and regional efforts towards elimination, but existing efforts to model the constraints of temperature on the malaria landscape at these scales have been simplistic. Here, we define an analytical framework to model these constraints appropriately at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, providing a detailed dynamic description that can enhance large scale malaria cartography as a decision-support tool in public health. RESULTS: We defined a dynamic biological model that incorporated the principal mechanisms of temperature dependency in the malaria transmission cycle and used it with fine spatial and temporal resolution temperature data to evaluate time-series of temperature suitability for transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax throughout an average year, quantified using an index proportional to the basic reproductive number. Time-series were calculated for all 1 km resolution land pixels globally and were summarised to create high-resolution maps for each species delineating those regions where temperature precludes transmission throughout the year. Within suitable zones we mapped for each pixel the number of days in which transmission is possible and an integrated measure of the intensity of suitability across the year. The detailed evaluation of temporal suitability dynamics provided by the model is visualised in a series of accompanying animations. CONCLUSIONS: These modelled products, made available freely in the public domain, can support the refined delineation of populations at risk; enhance endemicity mapping by offering a detailed, dynamic, and biologically driven alternative to the ubiquitous empirical incorporation of raw temperature data in geospatial models; and provide a rich spatial and temporal platform for future biological modelling studies.},

Typically, targeted in non-coding regions, microhaplotypes in exonic regions can be designed with larger amplicons to capture functional non-synonymous sites and minimise insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms. Quality control is an important first step for high-confidence genotyping to counteract such false-positive variants. As genetic markers with higher polymorphism compared to biallelic SNPs, it is critical to ensure sequencing errors across the microhaplotype amplicon are filtered out to avoid introducing false-haplotypes. We developed the MhGeneS pipeline which works in tandem with Seq2Sat to help validate microhaplotype genotyping of the coding region of genes, with broader applicability to any microhaplotype profiling. We genotyped microhaplotype regions of the Zfx (≅\,160\,bp) and Zfy (≅\,140\,bp) genes, as well as an exon of the prion protein (Prnp) gene (≅\,370\,bp) in caribou (Rangifer tarandus) using paired-end Illumina technology. As important quality metrics affecting microhaplotype calling, we identified the sequencing error rate profile related to the overlap or non-overlap of paired-end reads as well as the read depth as significant. In the case of Prnp, we achieved confident microhaplotype calling through MhGeneS by removing small sections of the 5' and 3' amplicons and using a minimum read depth of 20. Read depth and sequence trimming may be locus-specific, and validation of these parameters is recommended before the high-throughput profiling of samples.},

  abstract = {A major motivation for developing molecular methods for malaria surveillance is to measure the impact of control interventions on the population genetics of Plasmodium falciparum as a potential marker of progress towards elimination. Here we assess three established methods (i) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) barcoding (panel of 24-biallelic loci), (ii) microsatellite genotyping (panel of 12-multiallelic loci), and (iii) varcoding (fingerprinting var gene diversity, akin to microhaplotyping) to identify changes in parasite population genetics in response to a short-term indoor residual spraying (IRS) intervention. Typical of high seasonal transmission in Africa, multiclonal infections were found in 82.3\% (median 3; range 1-18) and 57.8\% (median 2; range 1-12) of asymptomatic individuals pre- and post-IRS, respectively, in Bongo District, Ghana. Since directly phasing multilocus haplotypes for population genetic analysis is not possible for biallelic SNPs and microsatellites, we chose \textasciitilde 200 low-complexity infections biased to single and double clone infections for analysis. Each genotyping method presented a different pattern of change in diversity and population structure as a consequence of variability in usable data and the relative polymorphism of the molecular markers (i.e., SNPs {$<$} microsatellites {$<$} var). Varcoding and microsatellite genotyping showed the overall failure of the IRS intervention to significantly change the population structure from pre-IRS characteristics (i.e., many diverse genomes of low genetic similarity). The 24-SNP barcode provided limited information for analysis, largely due to the biallelic nature of SNPs leading to a high proportion of double-allele calls and a view of more isolate relatedness compared to microsatellites and varcoding. Relative performance, suitability, and cost-effectiveness of the methods relevant to sample size and local malaria elimination in high-transmission endemic areas are discussed.},

  abstract = {The West Nile Virus (WNV) is an infectious disease spreading rapidly throughout the United States, causing illness among thousands of birds, animals, and humans. Yet, we only have a rudimentary understanding of how the mosquito-borne virus operates in complex avian–human environmental systems. The four broad categories of risk factors underlying WNV incidences are: environmental (temperature, precipitation, wetlands), socioeconomic (housing age), built-environment (catch basins, ditches), and existing mosquito abatement policies. This research first built a model incorporating the non-linear relationship between WNV incidences and hypothesized risk factors and second, identified important factor(s) whose management would result in effective disease prevention and containment. The research was conducted in the Metropolitan area of Minnesota, which had experienced significant WNV outbreaks from 2002. Computational neural network (CNN) modeling was used to understand the occurrence of WNV infected dead birds because of their ability to capture complex relationships with higher accuracy than linear models. Further a detailed interpretation technique, based on weights and biases of the network, provided a means for extracting relationships between risk factors and disease occurrence. Five risk factors: proximity to bogs, lakes, temperature, housing age, and developed medium density land cover class, were selected by the model. The detailed interpretation indicated that temperature, age of houses, and developed medium density land cover were positively related, and distance to bogs and lakes were negatively related to the incidence of WNV. This paper provides both applied and methodological contributions to the field of health geography. The relationships between the risk factors and disease occurrence could contribute to vector control strategies such as targeted insecticide spraying near bogs and lakes, mosquito control treatments for older houses, and extensive mapping, inspection, and treatments of catch basins. The proposed interpretation technique expanded the role of CNN models in health sciences as both predictive and explanatory tools.},

  abstract = {Malaria results in over 600,000 deaths annually, with the highest burden of deaths in young children living in sub-Saharan Africa. Molecular surveillance can provide important information for malaria control policies, including detection of antimalarial drug resistance. However, genome sequencing capacity in malaria-endemic countries is limited. We designed and implemented an end-to-end workflow to detect Plasmodium falciparum antimalarial resistance markers and diversity in the vaccine target circumsporozoite protein (csp) using nanopore sequencing in Ghana. We analysed 196 clinical samples and showed that our method is rapid, robust, accurate and straightforward to implement. Importantly, our method could be applied to dried blood spot samples, which are readily collected in endemic settings. We report that P. falciparum parasites in Ghana are mostly susceptible to chloroquine, with persistent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance and no evidence of artemisinin resistance. Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in csp, but their significance is uncertain. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of nanopore sequencing for malaria genomic surveillance in endemic countries.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To design and implement surveys of malaria infection and coverage of malaria control interventions among school children in Kenya in order to contribute towards a nationwide assessment of malaria. METHODS: The country was stratified into distinct malaria transmission zones based on a malaria risk map and 480 schools were visited between October 2008 and March 2010. Surveys were conducted in two phases: an initial opportunistic phase whereby schools were selected for other research purposes; and a second phase whereby schools were purposively selected to provide adequate spatial representation across the country. Consent for participation was based on passive, opt-out consent rather than written, opt-in consent because of the routine, low-risk nature of the survey. All children were diagnosed for Plasmodium infection using rapid diagnostic tests, assessed for anaemia and were interviewed about mosquito net usage, recent history of illness, and socio-economic and household indicators. Children's responses were entered electronically in the school and data transmitted nightly to Nairobi using a mobile phone modem connection. RDT positive results were corrected by microscopy and all results were adjusted for clustering using random effect regression modelling. RESULTS: 49,975 children in 480 schools were sampled, at an estimated cost of US\$ 1,116 per school. The overall prevalence of malaria and anaemia was 4.3\% and 14.1\%, respectively, and 19.0\% of children reported using an insecticide-treated net (ITN). The prevalence of infection showed marked variation across the country, with prevalence being highest in Western and Nyanza provinces, and lowest in Central, North Eastern and Eastern provinces. Nationally, 2.3\% of schools had reported ITN use {$>$}60\%, and low reported ITN use was a particular problem in Western and Nyanza provinces. Few schools reported having malaria health education materials or ongoing malaria control activities. CONCLUSION: School malaria surveys provide a rapid, cheap and sustainable approach to malaria surveillance which can complement household surveys, and in Kenya, show that large areas of the country do not merit any direct school-based control, but school-based interventions, coupled with strengthened community-based strategies, are warranted in western and coastal Kenya. The results also provide detailed baseline data to inform evaluation of school-based malaria control in Kenya.},

The European Project “Splash” conducted a survey of the literature and of DSS implementation in developing countries with specific reference on Africa. Experts in the field were consulted through an ad hoc questionnaire and interviews. The results of the survey indicate that the exchange of experiences amongst projects with similar objectives or even the same case study is very limited, with a tendency towards restarting every time from scratch. As a consequence, it seems that DSS developments have produced only limited positive impacts. Most experts contacted shared either the frustration deriving from the limited impacts on intended end-users, who rarely used the tool after the project end, or in the case of ongoing projects, the preoccupation for future maintenance. Responses from the questionnaires indicate that priority efforts should not focus on developing the tools, but rather on improving the effectiveness and applicability of integrated water resource management legislative and planning frameworks, training and capacity building, networking and cooperation, harmonization of transnational data infrastructures and, very importantly, learning from past experiences and adopting enhanced protocols for DSS development.},

  abstract = {Plasmodium vivax has been largely neglected over the past century, despite a widespread recognition of its burden across region where it is endemic. The parasite invades reticulocytes, employing the interaction between Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) and human Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC). However, P. vivax has now been observed in Duffy-negative individuals, presenting a potentially serious public health problem as the majority of African populations are Duffy-negative. Invasion of Duffy-negative reticulocytes is suggested to be through duplication of the PvDBP and a novel protein encoded by P. vivax erythrocyte binding protein (EBP) genes. The emergence and spread of specific P. vivax strains with ability to invade Duffy-negative reticulocytes has, therefore, drawn substantial attention and further complicated the epidemiology and public health implication of vivax malaria. Given the right environment and vectorial capacity for transmission coupled with the parasite’s ability to invade Duffy-negative individuals, P. vivax could increase its epidemiological significance in Africa. In this review, authors present accruing knowledge on the paradigm shift in P. vivax invasion of Duffy-negative reticulocytes against the established mechanism of invading only Duffy-positive individuals and offer a perspective on the epidemiological diagnostic and public health implication in Africa.},

  abstract = {Sex-biased demography, in which parameters governing migration and population size differ between females and males, has been studied through comparisons of X chromosomes, which are inherited sex-specifically, and autosomes, which are not. A common form of sex bias in humans is sex-biased admixture, in which at least one of the source populations differs in its proportions of females and males contributing to an admixed population. Studies of sex-biased admixture often examine the mean ancestry for markers on the X chromosome in relation to the autosomes. A simple framework noting that in a population with equally many females and males, two-thirds of X chromosomes appear in females, suggests that the mean X-chromosomal admixture fraction is a linear combination of female and male admixture parameters, with coefficients 2/3 and 1/3, respectively. Extending a mechanistic admixture model to accommodate the X chromosome, we demonstrate that this prediction is not generally true in admixture models, although it holds in the limit for an admixture process occurring as a single event. For a model with constant ongoing admixture, we determine the mean X-chromosomal admixture, comparing admixture on female and male X chromosomes to corresponding autosomal values. Surprisingly, in reanalyzing African-American genetic data to estimate sex-specific contributions from African and European sources, we find that the range of contributions compatible with the excess African ancestry on the X chromosome compared to autosomes has a wide spread, permitting scenarios either without male-biased contributions from Europe or without female-biased contributions from Africa.},

Aligned with this goal, the primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of utilizing local spatial variations to uncover the statistical relationships between malaria incidence rate and environmental and behavioral factors across the counties of Kenya. Two data sources are used—Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys of 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, and the national Malaria Indicator Survey of 2015. The spatial analysis shows clustering of counties with high malaria incidence rate, or hot spots, in the Lake Victoria region and the east coastal area around Mombasa; there are significant clusters of counties with low incidence rate, or cold spot areas in Nairobi. We apply an analysis technique, geographically weighted regression, that helps to better model how environmental and social determinants are related to malaria incidence rate while accounting for the confounding effects of spatial non-stationarity. Some general patterns persist over the four years of observation. We establish that variables including rainfall, proximity to water, vegetation, and population density, show differential impacts on the incidence of malaria in Kenya. The El-Nino–southern oscillation (ENSO) event in 2015 was significant in driving up malaria in the southern region of Lake Victoria compared with prior time-periods. The applied spatial multivariate clustering analysis indicates the significance of social and behavioral survey responses. This study can help build a better spatially explicit predictive model for malaria in Kenya capturing the role and spatial distribution of environmental, social, behavioral, and other characteristics of the households.},

  abstract = {Humans have altered ecosystems worldwide, and it is important to understand how this land use change impacts infectious disease transmission in humans and animals. We conducted a systematic review 305 scientific articles investigating how specific types of anthropogenic land use change influence infectious disease dynamics. We summarized findings, highlighted common themes, and drew attention to neglected areas of research. There was an increase in publications on this topic over the last 30~years spanning diseases of humans, livestock, and wildlife, including a large number of zoonotic pathogens. Most papers (66.9\%) were observational, 30.8\% were review or concept papers, and few studies (2.3\%) were experimental in nature, with most studies focusing on vector-borne and/or multi-host pathogens. Common land use change types related to disease transmission were deforestation/forest fragmentation/habitat fragmentation, agricultural development/irrigation, and urbanization/suburbanization. In response to anthropogenic change, more than half of the studies (56.9\%) documented increased pathogen transmission, 10.4\% of studies observed decreased pathogen transmission, 30.4\% had variable and complex pathogen responses, and 2.4\% showed no detectable changes. Commonly reported mechanisms by which land use change altered infectious disease transmission included alteration of the vector, host, and pathogen niche, changes in host and vector community composition, changes in behavior or movement of vectors and/or hosts, altered spatial distribution of hosts and/or vectors, and socioeconomic factors, and environmental contamination. We discussed observed patterns in the literature and make suggestions for future research directions, emphasizing the importance of ecological and evolutionary theory to understand pathogen responses in changing landscapes.},

Accordingly, efforts are now being directed toward ensuring an equitable spatial distribution of exposure to convicted sex offenders. In particular, laws are being enacted or resurrected to thwart such clusters.

We review and develop methodologies for use in assessing and managing residential impacts.

A mixed methods study assessed the vulnerability to malaria among the Jarai population living on both sides of the border in the provinces of Ratanakiri (Cambodia) and Gia Lai (Vietnam). A qualitative study generated preliminary hypotheses that were quantified in two surveys, one targeting youth (N = 498) and the other household leaders (N = 449). Jarai male youth, especially in Cambodia, had lower uptake of preventive measures (57.4\%) and more often stayed overnight in the deep forest (35.8\%) compared with the female youth and the adult population. Among male youth, a high-risk subgroup was identified that regularly slept at friends' homes or outdoors, who had fewer bed nets (32.5\%) that were torn more often (77.8\%). The vulnerability of Jarai youth to malaria could be attributed to the transitional character of youth itself, implying less fixed sleeping arrangements in nonpermanent spaces or non-bed sites.

  abstract = {Malaria connectivity describes the flow of parasites among transmission sources and sinks within a given landscape. Because of the spatial and temporal scales at which parasites are transported by their hosts, malaria sub-populations are largely defined by mosquito movement and malaria connectivity among them is largely driven by human movement. Characterising malaria connectivity thus requires characterising human travel between areas with differing levels of exposure to malaria. Whilst understanding malaria connectivity is fundamental for optimising interventions, particularly in areas seeking or sustaining elimination, there is a dearth of human movement data required to achieve this goal. Malaria indicator surveys (MIS) are a generally under utilised but potentially rich source of travel data that provide a unique opportunity to study simple associations between malaria infection and human travel in large population samples. This paper shares the experience working with MIS data from Bioko Island that revealed programmatically useful information regarding malaria importation through human travel. Simple additions to MIS questionnaires greatly augmented the level of detail of the travel data, which can be used to characterise human travel patterns and malaria connectivity to assist targeting interventions. It is argued that MIS potentially represent very important and timely sources of travel data that need to be further exploited.},

  abstract = {The ability of the malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax to invade erythrocytes is dependent on the expression of the Duffy blood group antigen on erythrocytes. Consequently, Africans who are null for the Duffy antigen are not susceptible to P. vivax infections. Recently, P. vivax infections in Duffy-null Africans have been documented, raising the possibility that P. vivax, a virulent pathogen in other parts of the world, may expand malarial disease in Africa. P. vivax binds the Duffy blood group antigen through its Duffy-binding protein 1 (DBP1). To determine if mutations in DBP1 resulted in the ability of P. vivax to bind Duffy-null erythrocytes, we analyzed P. vivax parasites obtained from two Duffy-null individuals living in Ethiopia where Duffy-null and -positive Africans live side-by-side. We determined that, although the DBP1s from these parasites contained unique sequences, they failed to bind Duffy-null erythrocytes, indicating that mutations in DBP1 did not account for the ability of P. vivax to infect Duffy-null Africans. However, an unusual DNA expansion of DBP1 (three and eight copies) in the two Duffy-null P. vivax infections suggests that an expansion of DBP1 may have been selected to allow low-affinity binding to another receptor on Duffy-null erythrocytes. Indeed, we show that Salvador (Sal) I P. vivax infects Squirrel monkeys independently of DBP1 binding to Squirrel monkey erythrocytes. We conclude that P. vivax Sal I and perhaps P. vivax in Duffy-null patients may have adapted to use new ligand–receptor pairs for invasion.},

To this end, we typed 14 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers in 185 P. vivax patient isolates collected from 13 districts in Sri Lanka over a period of 5 years (2003-2007). Overall, we found a high degree of polymorphism, with 184 unique haplotypes (12-46 alleles per locus) and average genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity) of 0·8744. Almost 69\% (n = 127) isolates had multiple-clone infections (MCI). Significant spatial and temporal differentiation (F ST = 0·04-0·25; P⩽0·0009) between populations was observed. The effective population size was relatively high but showed a decline from 2003-4 to 2006-7 periods (estimated as 45 661 to 22 896 or 10 513 to 7057, depending on the underlying model used). We used three approaches - namely, mode-shift in allele frequency distribution, detection of heterozygote excess and the M-ratio statistics - to test for evidence of a recent population bottleneck but only the low values of M-ratio statistics (ranging between 0·15-0·33, mean 0·26) were suggestive of such a bottleneck. The persistence of high genetic diversity and high proportion of MCI, with little change in effective population size, despite the collapse in demographic population size of P. vivax in Sri Lanka indicates the importance of maintaining stringent control and surveillance measures to prevent resurgence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rabies is a significant public health problem in China. Previous spatial epidemiological studies have helped understand the epidemiology of animal and human rabies in China. However, quantification of effects derived from relevant factors was insufficient and complex spatial interactions were not well articulated, which may lead to non-negligible bias. In this study, we aimed to quantify the role of socio-economic and climate factors in the spatial distribution of human rabies to support decision making pertaining to rabies control in China. METHODS: We conducted a multivariate analysis of human rabies in China with explicit consideration for spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence effects. The panel of 20,368 cases reported between 2005 and 2013 and their socio-economic and climate factors was implemented in regression models. Several significant covariates were extracted, including the longitude, the average temperature, the distance to county center, the distance to the road network and the distance to the nearest rabies case. The GMM was adopted to provide unbiased estimation with respect to heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. RESULTS: The analysis explained the inferred relationships between the counts of cases aggregated to 271 spatially-defined cells and the explanatory variables. The results suggested that temperature, longitude, the distance to county centers and the distance to the road network are positively associated with the local incidence of human rabies while the distance to newly occurred rabies cases has a negative correlation. With heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation taken into consideration, the estimation of regression models performed better. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that climatic and socioeconomic factors have significant influence on the spread of human rabies in China as they continuously affect the living environments of humans and animals, which critically impacts on how timely local citizens can gain access to post-exposure prophylactic services. Moreover, through comparisons between traditional regression models and the aggregation model that allows for heterogeneity and spatial effects, we demonstrated the validity and advantage of the aggregation model. It outperformed the existing models and decreased the estimation bias brought by omission of the spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence effects. Statistical results are readily translated into public health policy takeaways.},

We analyze whole genome sequence data generated from 640 new and 3089 publicly available Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates. We demonstrate that positive selection distorts IBD distributions, leading to underestimated effective population size and blurred population structure. Additionally, we discover that the removal of IBD peak regions partially restores the accuracy of IBD-based inferences, with this effect contingent on the population's background genetic relatedness and extent of~inbreeding. Consequently, we advocate for selection correction for parasite populations undergoing strong, recent positive selection, particularly in high malaria transmission settings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although effective treatment for malaria is now available, approximately half of the global population remain at risk of the disease particularly in developing countries. To design effective malaria control strategies there is need to understand the pattern of malaria heterogeneity in an area. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to explore the spatial and spatio-temporal pattern of malaria cases in Zimbabwe based on malaria data aggregated at district level from 2011 to 2016. METHODS: Geographical information system (GIS) and spatial scan statistic were applied on passive malaria data collected from health facilities and aggregated at district level to detect existence of spatial clusters. The global Moran's I test was used to infer the presence of spatial autocorrelation while the purely spatial retrospective analyses were performed to detect the spatial clusters of malaria cases with high rates based on the discrete Poisson model. Furthermore, space-time clusters with high rates were detected through the retrospective space-time analysis based on the discrete Poisson model. RESULTS: Results showed that there is significant positive spatial autocorrelation in malaria cases in the study area. In addition, malaria exhibits spatial heterogeneity as evidenced by the existence of statistically significant (P\,{$<$}\,0.05) spatial and space-time clusters of malaria in specific geographic regions. The detected primary clusters persisted in the eastern region of the study area over the six year study period while the temporal pattern of malaria reflected the seasonality of the disease where clusters were detected within particular months of the year. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic regions characterised by clusters of high rates were identified as malaria high risk areas. The results of this study could be useful in prioritizing resource allocation in high-risk areas for malaria control and elimination particularly in resource limited settings such as Zimbabwe. The results of this study are also useful to guide further investigation into the possible determinants of persistence of high clusters of malaria cases in particular geographic regions which is useful in reducing malaria burden in such areas.},

  abstract = {Targeted intervention and resource allocation are essential for effective malaria control, particularly in remote areas, with predictive models providing important information for decision making. While a diversity of modeling technique have been used to create predictive models of malaria, no work has made use of Bayesian networks. Bayes nets are attractive due to their ability to represent uncertainty, model time lagged and nonlinear relations, and provide explanations. This paper explores the use of Bayesian networks to model malaria, demonstrating the approach by creating village level models with weekly temporal resolution for Tha Song Yang district in northern Thailand. The networks are learned using data on cases and environmental covariates. Three types of networks are explored: networks for numeric prediction, networks for outbreak prediction, and networks that incorporate spatial autocorrelation. Evaluation of the numeric prediction network shows that the Bayes net has prediction accuracy in terms of mean absolute error of about 1.4 cases for 1 week prediction and 1.7 cases for 6 week prediction. The network for outbreak prediction has an ROC AUC above 0.9 for all prediction horizons. Comparison of prediction accuracy of both Bayes nets against several traditional modeling approaches shows the Bayes nets to outperform the other models for longer time horizon prediction of high incidence transmission. To model spread of malaria over space, we elaborate the models with links between the village networks. This results in some very large models which would be far too laborious to build by hand. So we represent the models as collections of probability logic rules and automatically generate the networks. Evaluation of the models shows that the autocorrelation links significantly improve prediction accuracy for some villages in regions of high incidence. We conclude that spatiotemporal Bayesian networks are a highly promising modeling alternative for prediction of malaria and other vector-borne diseases.},

  abstract = {Lack of national data on water-related ecosystems is a major challenge to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 targets by 2030. Monitoring surface water extent, wetlands, and water quality from space can be an important asset for many countries in support of SDG 6 reporting. We demonstrate the potential for Earth observation (EO) data to support country reporting for SDG Indicator 6.6.1, 'Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time' and identify important considerations for countries using these data for SDG reporting. The spatial extent of water-related ecosystems, and the partial quality of water within these ecosystems is investigated for seven countries. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 5, 7, and 8 with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) are used to measure surface water extent at 250 m and 30 m spatial resolution, respectively, in Cambodia, Jamaica, Peru, the Philippines, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia. The extent of mangroves is mapped at 30 m spatial resolution using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-1, and SRTM data for Jamaica, Peru, and Senegal. Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A imagery, total suspended solids and chlorophyll-a are mapped over time for a select number of large surface water bodies in Peru, Senegal, and Zambia. All of the EO datasets used are of global coverage and publicly available at no cost. The temporal consistency and long time-series of many of the datasets enable replicability over time, making reporting of change from baseline values consistent and systematic. We find that statistical comparisons between different surface water data products can help provide some degree of confidence for countries during their validation process and highlight the need for accuracy assessments when using EO-based land change data for SDG reporting. We also raise concern that EO data in the context of SDG Indicator 6.6.1 reporting may be more challenging for some countries, such as small island nations, than others to use in assessing the extent of water-related ecosystems due to scale limitations and climate variability. Country-driven validation of the EO data products remains a priority to ensure successful data integration in support of SDG Indicator 6.6.1 reporting. Multi-country studies such as this one can be valuable tools for helping to guide the evolution of SDG monitoring methodologies and provide a useful resource for countries reporting on water-related ecosystems. The EO data analyses and statistical methods used in this study can be easily replicated for country-driven validation of EO data products in the future.},

It is homologous to the mouse Small eye (Pax-6) gene and to the Aniridia gene in humans. These genes share extensive sequence identity, the position of three intron splice sites is conserved, and these genes are expressed similarly in the developing nervous system and in the eye during morphogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations in both the insect and in the mammalian genes have been shown to lead to a reduction or absence of eye structures, which suggests that ey functions in eye morphogenesis. By targeted expression of the ey complementary DNA in various imaginal disc primordia of Drosophila, ectopic eye structures were induced on the wings, the legs, and on the antennae. The ectopic eyes appeared morphologically normal and consisted of groups of fully differentiated ommatidia with a complete set of photoreceptor cells. These results support the proposition that ey is the master control gene for eye morphogenesis. Because homologous genes are present in vertebrates, ascidians, insects, cephalopods, and nemerteans, ey may function as a master control gene throughout the metazoa.},

However, we argue that obtaining accurate allele frequencies and accurate estimates of diversity are much more important than detecting all of the alleles, given that very rare alleles (i.e. new mutations) are not very informative for assessing genetic diversity within a population or genetic structure among populations. Here we present a comparison of allele frequencies, expected heterozygosities and genetic distances between real and simulated populations by randomly subsampling 5–100 individuals from four empirical microsatellite genotype datasets (Formica lugubris, Sciurus vulgaris, Thalassarche melanophris, and Himantopus novaezelandia) to create 100 replicate datasets at each sample size. Despite differences in taxon (two birds, one mammal, one insect), population size, number of loci and polymorphism across loci, the degree of differences between simulated and empirical dataset allele frequencies, expected heterozygosities and pairwise FST values were almost identical among the four datasets at each sample size. Variability in allele frequency and expected heterozygosity among replicates decreased with increasing sample size, but these decreases were minimal above sample sizes of 25 to 30. Therefore, there appears to be little benefit in sampling more than 25 to 30 individuals per population for population genetic studies based on microsatellite allele frequencies.},

The objective is to recover the epidemic transmission tree, which identifies who infected whom. This paper reviews the various approaches that have been taken. The first step is to define a measure of difference between sequences, which must be done while taking into account such factors as recombination and convergent evolution. Three broad categories of method exist, of increasing complexity: those that assume no withinhost genetic diversity or mutation, those that assume no within-host diversity but allow mutation, and those that allow both. Until recently, the assumption was usually made that every host in the epidemic could be identified, but this is now being relaxed, and some methods are intended for sparsely sampled data, concentrating on the identification of pairs of sequences that are likely to be the result of direct transmission rather than inferring the complete transmission tree. Many of the procedures described here are available to researchers as free software.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A multidrug-resistant co-lineage of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, named KEL1/PLA1, spread across Cambodia in 2008-13, causing high rates of treatment failure with the frontline combination therapy dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Here, we report on the evolution and spread of KEL1/PLA1 in subsequent years. METHODS: For this genomic epidemiology study, we analysed whole genome sequencing data from P falciparum clinical samples collected from patients with malaria between 2007 and 2018 from Cambodia, Laos, northeastern Thailand, and Vietnam, through the MalariaGEN P falciparum Community Project. Previously unpublished samples were provided by two large-scale multisite projects: the Tracking Artemisinin Resistance Collaboration II (TRAC2) and the Genetic Reconnaissance in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GenRe-Mekong) project. By investigating genome-wide relatedness between parasites, we inferred patterns of shared ancestry in the KEL1/PLA1 population. FINDINGS: We analysed 1673 whole genome sequences that passed quality filters, and determined KEL1/PLA1 status in 1615. Before 2009, KEL1/PLA1 was only found in western Cambodia; by 2016-17 its prevalence had risen to higher than 50\% in all of the surveyed countries except for Laos. In northeastern Thailand and Vietnam, KEL1/PLA1 exceeded 80\% of the most recent P falciparum parasites. KEL1/PLA1 parasites maintained high genetic relatedness and low diversity, reflecting a recent common origin. Several subgroups of highly related parasites have recently emerged within this co-lineage, with diverse geographical distributions. The three largest of these subgroups (n=84, n=79, and n=47) mostly emerged since 2016 and were all present in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. These expanding subgroups carried new mutations in the crt gene, which arose on a specific genetic background comprising multiple genomic regions. Four newly emerging crt mutations were rare in the early period and became more prevalent by 2016-17 (Thr93Ser, rising to 19·8\%; His97Tyr to 11·2\%; Phe145Ile to 5·5\%; and Ile218Phe to 11·1\%). INTERPRETATION: After emerging and circulating for several years within Cambodia, the P falciparum KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage diversified into multiple subgroups and acquired new genetic features, including novel crt mutations. These subgroups have rapidly spread into neighbouring countries, suggesting enhanced fitness. These findings highlight the urgent need for elimination of this increasingly drug-resistant parasite co-lineage, and the importance of genetic surveillance in accelerating malaria elimination efforts.

  abstract = {The use of spatial data in malaria elimination strategies is important to understand whether targeted interventions against malaria can be used, particularly in areas with limited resources. We previously documented consistent areas of increased malaria incidence in the epidemic-prone area of Kipsamoite in highland Kenya from 2001 to 2004. In this area and a neighboring subcounty (Kapsisiywa), malaria incidence decreased substantially in 2005, going from peak incidence of 31.7 per 1,000 persons in June 2004 to peak incidence of 7.4 per 1,000 persons in May 2005. Subsequently, the use of indoor residual spraying and artemisinin combination therapy malaria treatment led to a possible interruption of malaria transmission for a 13-month period from 2007 to 2008, after which the incidence returned to very low levels until an epidemic in April-July 2013. In the present study, we used novel kernel density estimation methods to determine whether areas of increased malaria incidence were consistent in six periods of peak incidence from 2003 to 2013, and to assess patterns of incidence in the period before versus. after the period of possible interruption. Areas of highest incidence differed during peak malaria transmission periods over the years 2003-2013, and differed before and after the potential malaria interruption. In this epidemic-prone region with very low malaria transmission, consistent malaria "hotspots" identified in a time of higher transmission are no longer present. Ongoing assessment of spatial malaria epidemiology to identify and target current areas of elevated malaria risk may be important in campaigns to control or eliminate malaria in epidemic-prone areas.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resistance in malaria vectors to pyrethroids, the most widely used class of insecticides for malaria vector control, threatens the continued efficacy of vector control tools. Target-site resistance is an important genetic resistance mechanism caused by mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc) gene that encodes the pyrethroid target-site. Understanding the geographic distribution of target-site resistance, and temporal trends across different vector species, can inform strategic deployment of vector control tools. RESULTS: We develop a Bayesian statistical spatiotemporal model to interpret species-specific trends in the frequency of the most common resistance mutations, Vgsc-995S and Vgsc-995F, in three major malaria vector species Anopheles gambiae, An. coluzzii, and An. arabiensis over the period 2005-2017. The models are informed by 2418 observations of the frequency of each mutation in field sampled mosquitoes collected from 27 countries spanning western and eastern regions of Africa. For nine selected countries, we develop annual predictive maps which reveal geographically structured patterns of spread of each mutation at regional and continental scales. The results show associations, as well as stark differences, in spread dynamics of the two mutations across the three vector species. The coverage of ITNs was an influential predictor of Vgsc allele frequencies, with modelled relationships between ITN coverage and allele frequencies varying across species and geographic regions. We found that our mapped Vgsc allele frequencies are a significant partial predictor of phenotypic resistance to the pyrethroid deltamethrin in An. gambiae complex populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our predictive maps show how spatiotemporal trends in insecticide target-site resistance mechanisms in African An. gambiae vary across individual vector species and geographic regions. Molecular surveillance of resistance mechanisms will help to predict resistance phenotypes and track their spread.},

This paper details a multi-scale remote sensing approach for assessing the use of Sphagnum mosses as proxy indicators of near-surface hydrology. Several spectral indices developed from the near infra-red (NIR) and shortwave infra-red (SWIR) liquid water absorption bands, as well as a biophysical index can be correlated with measures of near-surface moisture in the laboratory, in the field and from airborne imagery. Data from all platforms revealed similar patterns in the spectral indices in relation to changes in moisture although the strength of correlations was reduced as the spatial scale increased. The rapid collection of temporally and spatially explicit hydrological data means that the technique has potential practical application for environmental managers and peatland scientists at the local scale. The task of up-scaling the technique for use in operational peatland hydrological monitoring to the global scale is challenging but achievable, and requires further investigation into the heterogeneity of near-surface moisture across Sphagnum patches and the application of novel image processing techniques to improve the spatial resolution of currently available satellite imagery.},

  abstract = {The successful implementation of pathogen genomic surveillance demands rapid, low-cost genotyping solutions for tracking infections. Here we demonstrate the capacity of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) barcodes to generate practical information for malaria surveillance and control. The study was conducted in Papua New Guinea (PNG), a country with a wide range of malaria transmission intensities. A panel of 191 candidate SNPs was selected from 5786 SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than 0.1, identified amongst 91 Plasmodium falciparum genomes from three provinces of PNG. We then genotyped 772 P. falciparum isolates from a 2008 nationwide malaria indicator survey and 31 clinical infections from an outbreak of unknown origin. We assessed the performance of SNP panels with different allele frequency characteristics, and measured population diversity, structure and connectivity using both whole genome data and the SNP barcode. The full SNP barcode captured similar patterns of population structure evident with 5786 ‘whole genome’ SNPs. Geographically informative SNPs (iSNPs, FST{$>$}0.05) show increased population clustering compared to the full barcode whilst randomly selected SNPs (rSNPs) and SNPs with similar allele frequencies (FST{$<$}0.05) amongst different countries (universal, uSNPs) or local PNG populations (balanced, bSNPs) indicated little clustering. Applied to samples from all endemic areas of PNG, this barcode identified variable transmission dynamics, and eight major populations. Genetic diversity was high throughout most areas, however, in the southern region, isolates were either closely related, suggesting highly inbred or near-clonal populations; or, they shared ancestry with other parasite populations, consistent with importation. Applied to outbreak samples, only the full barcode, the iSNPs and bSNPs distinguished between locally acquired and imported infections. The full barcode contains more than 100 SNPs prevalent in other endemic regions, allowing the transfer of this tool to other settings. SNP barcodes must be validated in local settings to ensure they capture the diversity and population structure of the target population. Subsets of geographically informative SNPs will be essential for predicting geographic origins but may bias analyses of population structure and gene flow if used alone. AUTHOR SUMMARY Pathogen genomic surveillance is a sensitive approach for mapping pathogen transmission dynamics to support decisions about how to prevent and control infectious diseases. High throughput genotyping tools known as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) barcodes are used to measure relationships between individuals and connectivity between populations, however, the barcode design may influence these results. We used whole genome sequences from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to design a barcode that captures the diversity both within and between parasite populations of Papua New Guinea (PNG), where transmission is variable amongst provinces. By investigating the performance of different panels of SNPs, we show that validation for use in the target population is crucial to correctly identifying population genetic structure. Applying the validated SNP barcode on hundreds of samples from all endemic provinces of PNG, high levels of variability in local transmission dynamics, and regions of population subdivision were observed. Some geographic areas show evidence of interrupted transmission, and the substantial genetic differentiation between the northern, eastern and island populations, presents an opportunity to design targeted, subnational control efforts. Application of the barcode to outbreak samples classified cases into imported and locally acquired infections, with substantial local transmission indicating control efforts were not sufficient to prevent the spread of infections. SNP barcodes are useful tools that can be used to supplement existing malaria surveillance tools however careful validation of their effectiveness in different settings is recommended.},

  abstract = {Given the veterinary and public health impact of vector-borne diseases, there is a clear need to assess the suitability of landscapes for the emergence and spread of these diseases. Current approaches for predicting disease risks neglect key features of the landscape as components of the functional habitat of vectors or hosts, and hence of the pathogen. Empirical–statistical methods do not explicitly incorporate biological mechanisms, whereas current mechanistic models are rarely spatially explicit; both methods ignore the way animals use the landscape (i.e. movement ecology). We argue that applying a functional concept for habitat, i.e. the resource-based habitat concept (RBHC), can solve these issues. The RBHC offers a framework to identify systematically the different ecological resources that are necessary for the completion of the transmission cycle and to relate these resources to (combinations of) landscape features and other environmental factors. The potential of the RBHC as a framework for identifying suitable habitats for vector-borne pathogens is explored and illustrated with the case of bluetongue virus, a midge-transmitted virus affecting ruminants. The concept facilitates the study of functional habitats of the interacting species (vectors as well as hosts) and provides new insight into spatial and temporal variation in transmission opportunities and exposure that ultimately determine disease risks. It may help to identify knowledge gaps and control options arising from changes in the spatial configuration of key resources across the landscape. The RBHC framework may act as a bridge between existing mechanistic and statistical modelling approaches.},

  abstract = {Background The African Union’s High-Level Panel on Emerging Technologies identified gene drive mosquitoes as a priority technology for malaria elimination. The first field trials are expected in 5–10 years in Uganda, Mali or Burkina Faso. In preparation, regional and international actors are developing risk governance guidelines which will delineate the framework for identifying and evaluating risks. Scientists and bioethicists have called for African stakeholder involvement in these developments, arguing the knowledge and perspectives of those people living in malaria-afflicted countries is currently missing. However, few African stakeholders have been involved to date, leaving a knowledge gap about the local social-cultural as well as ecological context in which gene drive mosquitoes will be tested and deployed. This study investigates and analyses Ugandan stakeholders’ hopes and concerns about gene drive mosquitoes for malaria control and explores the new directions needed for risk governance. Methods This qualitative study draws on 19 in-depth semi-structured interviews with Ugandan stakeholders in 2019. It explores their hopes for the technology and the risks they believed pertinent. Coding began at a workshop and continued through thematic analysis. Results Participants’ hopes and concerns for gene drive mosquitoes to address malaria fell into three themes: (1) ability of gene drive mosquitoes to prevent malaria infection; (2) impacts of gene drive testing and deployment; and, (3) governance. Stakeholder hopes fell almost exclusively into the first theme while concerns were spread across all three. The study demonstrates that local stakeholders are able and willing to contribute relevant and important knowledge to the development of risk frameworks. Conclusions International processes can provide high-level guidelines, but risk decision-making must be grounded in the local context if it is to be robust, meaningful and legitimate. Decisions about whether or not to release gene drive mosquitoes as part of a malaria control programme will need to consider the assessment of both the risks and the benefits of gene drive mosquitoes within a particular social, political, ecological, and technological context. Just as with risks, benefits—and importantly, the conditions that are necessary to realize them—must be identified and debated in Uganda and its neighbouring countries.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular surveillance of infectious diseases allows the monitoring of pathogens beyond the granularity of traditional epidemiological approaches and is well-established for some of the most relevant infectious diseases such as malaria. The presence of genetically distinct pathogenic variants within an infection, referred to as multiplicity of infection (MOI) or complexity of infection (COI) is common in malaria and similar infectious diseases. It is an important metric that scales with transmission intensities, potentially affects the clinical pathogenesis, and a confounding factor when monitoring the frequency and prevalence of pathogenic variants. Several statistical methods exist to estimate MOI and the frequency distribution of pathogen variants. However, a common problem is the quality of the underlying molecular data. If molecular assays fail not randomly, it is likely to underestimate MOI and the prevalence of pathogen variants. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A statistical model is introduced, which explicitly addresses data quality, by assuming a probability by which a pathogen variant remains undetected in a molecular assay. This is different from the assumption of missing at random, for which a molecular assay either performs perfectly or fails completely. The method is applicable to a single molecular marker and allows to estimate allele-frequency spectra, the distribution of MOI, and the probability of variants to remain undetected (incomplete information). Based on the statistical model, expressions for the prevalence of pathogen variants are derived and differences between frequency and prevalence are discussed. The usual desirable asymptotic properties of the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) are established by rewriting the model into an exponential family. The MLE has promising finite sample properties in terms of bias and variance. The covariance matrix of the estimator is close to the Cramér-Rao lower bound (inverse Fisher information). Importantly, the estimator's variance is larger than that of a similar method which disregards incomplete information, but its bias is smaller. CONCLUSIONS: Although the model introduced here has convenient properties, in terms of the mean squared error it does not outperform a simple standard method that neglects missing information. Thus, the new method is recommendable only for data sets in which the molecular assays produced poor-quality results. This will be particularly true if the model is extended to accommodate information from multiple molecular markers at the same time, and incomplete information at one or more markers leads to a strong depletion of sample size.},

  abstract = {Flood occurs in the lower Mekong basin in Cambodia annually from seasonal rain. Flood causes loss of life, destruction of public and private properties and disrupts the normal cultivating cycle. It hampers the economic development of the country since Cambodia depends heavily on agriculture for its economic growth. The study is undertaken to recreate the major flood event in the year 2000 in the lower Mekong basin in Cambodia for the four provinces of Kompong Cham, Prey Veng, Kandal and Phnom Penh. The main objective of the study was the simulation of the 1D flood model HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Centres River Analysis System) for the Mekong River and to estimate the flood depth and extent for the year 2000 flood event in the four provinces of Cambodia. The sub- objectives were to validate the model by comparing the flood inundation area and depth with the available flood maps and remote sensing image and prepare a hazard map using the model outputs and other socio-economic data. The geometric data for the river and flood plain were extracted from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using HEC-Geo-RAS module in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The data were then exported to HEC-RAS for further analysis. Flow data and boundary conditions were entered and the flow was simulated in HEC-RAS to obtain flow profiles corresponding to the maximum monthly discharges from 1991 to 2002. Validation of results for the most severe flood event of year 2000 was done by comparing of the HEC-RAS outputs with a flood map derived from RADARSAT-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image as well as field data. Hazard analysis comprised of the using the model output for hazard zonation in a GIS environment from a potential threat of a similar flood event like that of year 2000 using the socio-economic and ancillary data. From the result, it was observed that most of the areas of the four provinces were inundated by the year 2000 flood, which was verified by a base map prepared from SAR data acquired during the flood time. Phnom Penh city was not flooded due to dykes and the highway No.5. The scenarios were simulated in the model results. The flood depth for the year 2000 was achieved by deducting the water level of the driest season from the water level during the flood season using HEC-RAS model simulation for March and September respectively. Results show that the flood depth varies from 0 to 9.5 meter in the flood plain. This is in conformity with the data gathered during the field visit. It was observed that most of the area was under medium hazard zone. Area-wise Kandal province has the highest hazardous area. It was found that the flood affected 2,286 km of roads and a total of 449 schools.},

  abstract = {As the field of landscape genetics is progressing towards comparative empirical studies and meta-analysis, it is important to know how best to compare the strength of spatial genetic structure between studies and species. Moran’s Eigenvector Maps are a promising method that does not make an assumption of isolation-by-distance in a homogeneous environment but can discern cryptic structure that may result from multiple processes operating in heterogeneous landscapes. MEMgene uses spatial filters from Moran’s Eigenvector Maps as predictor variables to explain variation in a genetic distance matrix, and it returns adjusted R2 as a measure of the amount of genetic variation that is spatially structured. However, it is unclear whether, and under which conditions, this value can be used to compare the degree of spatial genetic structure (effect size) between studies. This study addresses the fundamental question of comparability at two levels: between independent studies (meta-analysis mode) and between species sampled at the same locations (comparative mode). We used published datasets containing 9,900 haploid, biallelic, neutral loci simulated on a quasi-continuous, square landscape under four demographic scenarios (island model, isolation-by-distance, expansion from one or two refugia). We varied the genetic resolution (number of individuals and loci) and the number of random sampling locations. We considered two measures of effect size, the MEMgene adjusted R2 and multivariate Moran’s I, which is related to Moran’s Eigenvector Maps. Both metrics were highly sensitive to the number of locations, even when using standardized effect sizes, SES, and the number of individuals sampled per location, but not to the number of loci. In comparative mode, using the same Moran Eigenvector Maps for all species, even those with missing values at some sampling locations, reduced bias due to the number of locations under isolation-by-distance (stationary process) but increased it under expansion from one or two refugia (non-stationary process). More robust measures of effect size need to be developed before the strength of spatial genetic structure can be accurately compared, either in a meta-analysis of independent empirical studies or within a comparative, multispecies landscape genetic study.},

However, VI-Ψstem correlations are mostly reported at the leaf or canopy scales, using proximal canopy-based sensors or very-high-spatial resolution images derived from sensors mounted on small airplanes or drones. Here, for the first time, we take advantage of high-spatial resolution (3-m) near-daily images acquired from Planet’s nano-satellite constellation to derive VI-Ψstem correlations at the vineyard scale. Weekly Ψstem was measured along the growing season of 2017 in six vines each in 81 commercial vineyards and in 60 pairs of grapevines in a 2.4 ha experimental vineyard in Israel. The Clip application programming interface (API), provided by Planet, and the Google Earth Engine platform were used to derive spatially continuous time series of four VIs—GNDVI, NDVI, EVI and SAVI—in the 82 vineyards. Results show that per-week multivariable linear models using variables extracted from VI time series successfully tracked spatial variations in Ψstem across the experimental vineyard (Pearson’s-r = 0.45–0.84; N = 60). A simple linear regression model enabled monitoring seasonal changes in Ψstem along the growing season in the vineyard (r = 0.80–0.82). Planet VIs and seasonal Ψstem data from the 82 vineyards were used to derive a ‘global’ model for in-season monitoring of Ψstem at the vineyard-level (r = 0.78; RMSE = 18.5\%; N = 970). The ‘global’ model, which requires only a few VI variables extracted from Planet images, may be used for real-time weekly assessment of Ψstem in Mediterranean vineyards, substantially improving the efficiency of conventional in-field monitoring efforts.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We found a significant reduction in genetic diversity in An. gambiae, but not in An. arabiensis as compared to prior to the 20-year period in western Kenya. Significant population structure among populations was found for both species. The most important ecological driver for dispersal and gene flow of An. gambiae and An. arabiensis was tree cover and cropland, respectively.

  abstract = {Landscape genetics aims to quantify the effect of landscape on gene flow. Broadly, the approach involves measuring genetic variation, quantifying landscape heterogeneity, and statistically testing the link between both genetic variation and landscape heterogeneity. This approach has been widely used by conservation biologists, for example to identify barriers restricting movement in threatened populations. More recently, landscape genetics has been used to study the epidemiology of infectious diseases, such as chronic wasting disease, raccoon rabies, and malaria. This method can be useful to identifying potential hotspot areas of disease movement for targeted public health interventions and containment of disease and drug resistance. However, vector-borne disease epidemiology is particularly complex, as it is affected by the movement of both the vector and human or vertebrate host. This feature could potentially inhibit the ability to detect the effect of landscape on gene flow, since the ecology of vectors and hosts are likely different and potentially conflicting. Here, we provide a summary of the latest innovations in the field of landscape genetics with a focus on those that could help increase the power to detect landscape effects in vector-borne human disease studies. We also provide a recommended framework for studying vector-borne diseases using a landscape genetics approach. Landscape genetics has the potential to be a powerful tool for the field of vector-borne disease epidemiology, but has so far been underutilized. The provided synthesis of tools and considerations for conducting a landscape genetics study of a vector-borne disease aim to bridge the gap between the two disciplines.},

Unfortunately however, IBD analyses have been underutilized in analysis of other organisms, including human pathogens. This is in part due to the lack of statistical methodologies for non-diploid genomes in addition to the added complexity of multiclonal infections. As such, we have developed an IBD methodology, called isoRelate, for analysis of haploid recombining microorganisms in the presence of multiclonal infections. Using the inferred IBD status at genomic locations, we have also developed a novel statistic for identifying loci under positive selection and propose relatedness networks as a means of exploring shared haplotypes within populations. We evaluate the performance of our methodologies for detecting IBD and selection, including comparisons with existing tools, then perform an exploratory analysis of whole genome sequencing data from a global Plasmodium falciparum dataset of more than 2500 genomes. This analysis identifies Southeast Asia as having many highly related isolates, possibly as a result of both reduced transmission from intensified control efforts and population bottlenecks following the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance. Many signals of selection are also identified, most of which overlap genes that are known to be associated with drug resistance, in addition to two novel signals observed in multiple countries that have yet to be explored in detail. Additionally, we investigate relatedness networks over the selected loci and determine that one of these sweeps has spread between continents while the other has arisen independently in different countries. IBD analysis of microorganisms using isoRelate can be used for exploring population structure, positive selection and haplotype distributions, and will be a valuable tool for monitoring disease control and elimination efforts of many diseases.},

  abstract = {There is an abundance of malaria genetic data being collected from the field, yet using these data to understand the drivers of regional epidemiology remains a challenge. A key issue is the lack of models that relate parasite genetic diversity to epidemiological parameters. Classical models in population genetics characterize changes in genetic diversity in relation to demographic parameters, but fail to account for the unique features of the malaria life cycle. In contrast, epidemiological models, such as the Ross-Macdonald model, capture malaria transmission dynamics but do not consider genetics. Here, we have developed an integrated model encompassing both parasite evolution and regional epidemiology. We achieve this by combining the Ross-Macdonald model with an intra-host continuous-time Moran model, thus explicitly representing the evolution of individual parasite genomes in a traditional epidemiological framework. Implemented as a stochastic simulation, we use the model to explore relationships between measures of parasite genetic diversity and parasite prevalence, a widely-used metric of transmission intensity. First, we explore how varying parasite prevalence influences genetic diversity at equilibrium. We find that multiple genetic diversity statistics are correlated with prevalence, but the strength of the relationships depends on whether variation in prevalence is driven by host- or vector-related factors. Next, we assess the responsiveness of a variety of statistics to malaria control interventions, finding that those related to mixed infections respond quickly (∼months) whereas other statistics, such as nucleotide diversity, may take decades to respond. These findings provide insights into the opportunities and challenges associated with using genetic data to monitor malaria epidemiology.},

  abstract = {Background BLOSUM matrices belong to the most commonly used substitution matrix series for protein homology search and sequence alignments since their publication in 1992. In 2008, Styczynski et al. discovered miscalculations in the clustering step of the matrix computation. Still, the RBLOSUM64 matrix based on the corrected BLOSUM code was reported to perform worse at a statistically significant level than the BLOSUM62., Here, we present a further correction of the (R)BLOSUM code and provide a thorough performance analysis of BLOSUM-, RBLOSUM- and the newly derived CorBLOSUM-type matrices. Thereby, we assess homology search performance of these matrix-types derived from three different BLOCKS databases on all versions of the ASTRAL20, ASTRAL40 and ASTRAL70 subsets resulting in 51 different benchmarks in total. Our analysis is focused on two of the most popular BLOSUM matrices — BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Results Our study shows that fixing small errors in the BLOSUM code results in substantially different substitution matrices with a beneficial influence on homology search performance when compared to the original matrices. The CorBLOSUM matrices introduced here performed at least as good as their BLOSUM counterparts in ∼75 \% of all test cases. On up-to-date ASTRAL databases BLOSUM matrices were even outperformed by CorBLOSUM matrices in more than 86 \% of the times. In contrast to the study by Styczynski et al., the tested RBLOSUM matrices also outperformed the corresponding BLOSUM matrices in most of the cases. Comparing the CorBLOSUM with the RBLOSUM matrices revealed no general performance advantages for either on older ASTRAL releases. On up-to-date ASTRAL databases however CorBLOSUM matrices performed better than their RBLOSUM counterparts in ∼74 \% of the test cases. Conclusions Our results imply that CorBLOSUM type matrices outperform the BLOSUM matrices on a statistically significant level in most of the cases, especially on up-to-date databases such as ASTRAL ≥2.01. Additionally, CorBLOSUM matrices are closer to those originally intended by Henikoff and Henikoff on a conceptual level. Hence, we encourage the usage of CorBLOSUM over (R)BLOSUM matrices for the task of homology search.

  abstract = {Sea Star Wasting Disease (SSWD) describes a suite of disease signs that affected {$>$} 20 species of asteroid since 2013 along a broad geographic range from the Alaska Peninsula to Baja California. Previous work identified the Sea Star associated Densovirus (SSaDV) as the best candidate pathogen for SSWD in 3 species of common asteroid (Pycnopodia helianthoides, Pisaster ochraceus and Evasterias troscheli), and virus-sized material ({$<$}0.22 µm) elicited SSWD signs in P. helianthoides. However, the ability of virus-sized material to elicit SSWD in other species of asteroids was not known. Discordance between detection of SSaDV by qPCR and by viral metagenomics inspired the redesign of qPCR primers to encompass SSaDV and two densoviral genotypes detected in wasting asteroids. Analysis of asteroid samples collected during SSWD emergence in 2013-2014 showed an association between wasting asteroid-associated densoviruses (WAaDs) and SSWD in only one species (P. helianthoides). WAaDs were found in association with asymptomatic asteroids in contemporary (2016 and later) populations, suggesting that they form subclinical infections at the times they were sampled. WAaDs were found in SSWD-affected P. helianthoides after being absent in asymptomatic individuals a year earlier at one location (Kodiak). Direct challenge of P. ochraceus, Pisaster brevispinus and E. troscheli with virus-sized material from SSWD-affected individuals did not elicit SSWD in any trial. RNA viral genomes discovered in viral metagenomes and host transcriptomes had viral loads and metagenome fragment recruitment patterns that were inconsistent with SSWD. Analysis of water temperature and precipitation patterns on a regional scale suggests that SSWD occurred following dry conditions at several locations, but mostly was inconsistently associated with either parameter. Semi-continuous monitoring of SSWD subtidally at two sites in the Salish Sea from 2013-2017 indicated that SSWD in E. troscheli and P. ochraceus was associated with elevated water temperatures, but wasting in P. helianthoides occurred irrespective of environmental conditions. Our data therefore do not support that widespread SSWD in species other than P. helianthoides is associated with potential viral pathogens. Rather, we speculate that SSWD may represent a syndrome of heterogeneous etiologies between geographic locations, between species, or even within a species between locations.},

Asteroid wasting describes a suite of body wall abnormalities that can ultimately result in animal mortality. Wasting in Northeast Pacific asteroids has gained considerable recent scientific attention due to its geographic extent, number of species affected, and effects on overall population density in some affected regions. However, asteroid wasting has been observed for over a century in other regions and species. Asteroids are subject to physical injury and adverse environmental conditions, which may result in very similar external manifestations to wasting, making identification of causative processes sometimes problematic. Here we review asteroid health abnormalities reported in years prior to the 2013–present Northeast Pacific wasting mass mortality, and report two additional geographically disparate wasting events that occurred concomitantly with the recent wasting outbreak.},

The population densities in the highlands ranged between 158 persons/km(2) in Ethiopia and 410 persons/km(2) in Rwanda. According to the United Nations Population Fund, the region has the world's highest population growth rate. These factors are likely behind the high rates of poverty among the populations. As there were no employment opportunities other than agricultural, this demographic pressure of poor populations have included in an extensive unprecedented land use and land cover changes such as modification of bushland, woodland, and grassland on hillsides to farmland and transformation of papyrus swamps in valley bottoms to dairy pastures and cropland and changing of fallows on hillsides from short or seasonal to longer or perennial. Areas harvested for food crops were therefore increased by more than 100\% in most of the highlands. The lost of forest areas, mainly due to subsistence agriculture, between 1990 and 2010 ranged between 8000 ha in Rwanda and 2,838,000 ha in Ethiopia. These unmitigated environmental changes in the highlands led to rise temperature and optimizing the spread and survival of malaria vectors and development of malaria parasites. Malaria in highlands was initially governed by low ambient temperature, trend of malaria transmission was therefore increased and several epidemics were observed in late 1980s and early 2000s. Although, malaria is decreasing through intensified interventions since mid 2000s onwards, these environmental changes might expose population in the highlands of east Africa to an increase risk of malaria and its epidemic particularly if the current interventions are not sustained.},

Advances in population demographic-genetic simulation software, especially with respect to individual life history, landscapes and genetic processes, are transforming and expanding the ways that molecular data can be used. The aim of this review is to explain the roles that such software can play in molecular ecology studies (whether as a principal component or a supporting function) so that researchers can decide whether, when and precisely how simulations can be incorporated into their work. First, I use seven case studies to demonstrate how simulations are employed, their specific advantage/necessity and what alternative or complementary (nonsimulation) approaches are available. I also explain how simulations can be integrated with existing spatial, environmental, historical and genetic data sets. I next describe simulation features that may be of interest to molecular ecologists, such as spatial and behavioural considerations and species' interactions, to provide guidance on how particular simulation capabilities can serve particular needs. Lastly, I discuss the prospect of simulation software in emerging challenges (climate change, biodiversity monitoring, population exploitation) and opportunities (genomics, ancient DNA), in order to emphasize that the scope of simulation-based work is expanding. I also suggest practical considerations, priorities and elements of best practice. This should accelerate the uptake of simulation approaches and firmly embed them as a versatile tool in the molecular ecologist's toolbox.},

Peatland erosion has severe effects on their ecological functions, such as water storage capacity. Thus, erosion monitoring is highly advisable. Erosion quantification and monitoring can be supported by high-resolution terrestrial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). In this study, a novel Geographic Information System (GIS)-based method for the automatic delineation and geomorphometric description of gullies in cushion peatlands is presented. The approach is a multi-step workflow based on a gully edge extraction and a sink filling algorithm applied to a conditioned digital terrain model. Our method enables the creation of GIS-ready polygons of the gullies and the derivation of geomorphometric parameters along the entire channel course. Automatically derived boundaries and gully area values correspond to a high degree (93\%) with manually digitized reference polygons. The set of methods developed in this study offers a suitable tool for the monitoring and scientific analysis of fluvial morphology in cushion peatlands.},

Using published malaria and mosquito surveys from Kenya, we analyzed the relationship between malaria prevalence and multiple axes of mosquito diversity: abundance, species richness, and composition. We found a net amplification of malaria prevalence by vector species richness, a result of a strong direct positive association between richness and prevalence alongside a weak indirect negative association between the two, mediated through mosquito community composition. One plausible explanation of these patterns is species niche complementarity, whereby less competent vector species contribute to disease transmission by filling spatial or temporal gaps in transmission left by dominant vectors. A greater understanding of vector community assemblage and function, as well as any interactions between host and vector biodiversity, could offer insights to both fundamental and applied ecology.},

The epidemiology of malaria in the Ethiopian highlands, and, in particular, the role of importation by human migration from the highly endemic lowlands is not well understood. We sequenced 187 Plasmodium falciparum samples from two sites in the Ethiopian highlands, Gondar (n = 159) and Ziway (n = 28), using a multiplexed droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-based amplicon sequencing method targeting 35 microhaplotypes and drug resistance loci. Here, we characterize the parasite population structure and genetic relatedness. We identify moderate parasite diversity (mean HE: 0.54) and low infection complexity (74.9\% monoclonal). A significant percentage of infections share microhaplotypes, even across transmission seasons and sites, indicating persistent local transmission. We identify multiple clusters of clonal or near-clonal infections, highlighting high genetic relatedness. Only 6.3\% of individuals diagnosed with P. falciparum reported recent travel. Yet, in clonal or near-clonal clusters, infections of travellers were frequently observed first in time, suggesting that parasites may have been imported and then transmitted locally. 31.1\% of infections are pfhrp2-deleted and 84.4\% pfhrp3-deleted, and 28.7\% have pfhrp2/3 double deletions. Parasites with pfhrp2/3 deletions and wild-type parasites are genetically distinct. Mutations associated with resistance to sulphadoxine–pyrimethamine or suggested to reduce sensitivity to lumefantrine are observed at near-fixation. In conclusion, genomic data corroborate local transmission and the importance of intensified control in the Ethiopian highlands.},

We investigated the effects of urbanization on genetic diversity and gene flow for two sympatric amphibian species, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), across a large ({$>$}35,000 km2) landscape in Maine, USA, containing numerous natural and anthropogenic gradients. Isolation-by-distance (IBD) patterns differed between the species. Spotted salamanders showed a linear and relatively high variance relationship between genetic and geographic distances (r = .057, p {$<$} .001), whereas wood frogs exhibited a strongly nonlinear and lower variance relationship (r = 0.429, p {$<$} .001). Scale dependence analysis of IBD found gene flow has its most predictable influence (strongest IBD correlations) at distances up to 9 km for spotted salamanders and up to 6 km for wood frogs. Estimated effective migration surfaces revealed contrasting patterns of high and low genetic diversity and gene flow between the two species. Population isolation, quantified as the mean IBD residuals for each population, was associated with local urbanization and less genetic diversity in both species. The influence of geographic proximity and urbanization on population connectivity was further supported by distance-based redundancy analysis and multiple matrix regression with randomization. Resistance surface modeling found interpopulation connectivity to be influenced by developed land cover, light roads, interstates, and topography for both species, plus secondary roads and rivers for wood frogs. Our results highlight the influence of anthropogenic landscape features within the context of natural features and broad spatial genetic patterns, in turn supporting the premise that while urbanization significantly restricts interpopulation connectivity for wood frogs and spotted salamanders, specific landscape elements have unique effects on these two sympatric species.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The burden of malaria in Vietnam has drastically reduced, prompting the National Malaria Control Program to officially engage in elimination efforts. Plasmodium vivax is becoming increasingly prevalent, remaining a major problem in the country's central and southern provinces. A better understanding of P. vivax genetic diversity and structure of local parasite populations will provide baseline data for the evaluation and improvement of current efforts for control and elimination. The aim of this study was to examine the population genetics and structure of P. vivax isolates from four communities in Tra Leng commune, Nam Tra My district in Quang Nam, Central Vietnam. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: P. vivax mono infections collected from 234 individuals between April 2009 and December 2010 were successfully analyzed using a panel of 14 microsatellite markers. Isolates displayed moderate genetic diversity (He = 0.68), with no significant differences between study communities. Polyclonal infections were frequent (71.4\%) with a mean multiplicity of infection of 1.91 isolates/person. Low but significant genetic differentiation (FST value from -0.05 to 0.18) was observed between the community across the river and the other communities. Strong linkage disequilibrium ([Formula: see text] = 0.113, p {$<$} 0.001) was detected across all communities, suggesting gene flow within and among them. Using multiple approaches, 101 haplotypes were grouped into two genetic clusters, while 60.4\% of haplotypes were admixed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In this area of Central Vietnam, where malaria transmission has decreased significantly over the past decade, there was moderate genetic diversity and high occurrence of polyclonal infections. Local human populations have frequent social and economic interactions that facilitate gene flow and inbreeding among parasite populations, while decreasing population structure. Findings provide important information on parasites populations circulating in the study area and are relevant to current malaria elimination efforts.},

  abstract = {Satellite sensing in the visible to near-infrared (VNIR) domain has been the backbone of land surface monitoring and characterization for more than four decades. However, a limitation of conventional single-sensor satellite missions is their limited capacity to observe land surface dynamics at the very high spatial and temporal resolutions demanded by a wide range of applications. One solution to this spatio-temporal divide is an observation strategy based on the CubeSat standard, which facilitates constellations of small, inexpensive satellites. Repeatable near-daily image capture in RGB and near-infrared (NIR) bands at 3–4\,m resolution has recently become available via a constellation of {$>$}130 CubeSats operated commercially by Planet. While the observing capacity afforded by this system is unprecedented, the relatively low radiometric quality and cross-sensor inconsistencies represent key challenges in the realization of their full potential as a game changer in Earth observation. To address this issue, we developed a Cubesat Enabled Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Method (CESTEM) that uses a multi-scale machine-learning technique to correct for radiometric inconsistencies between CubeSat acquisitions. The CESTEM produces Landsat 8 consistent atmospherically corrected surface reflectances in blue, green, red, and NIR bands, but at the spatial scale and temporal frequency of the CubeSat observations. An application of CESTEM over an agricultural dryland system in Saudi Arabia demonstrated CubeSat-based reproduction of Landsat 8 consistent VNIR data with an overall relative mean absolute deviation of 1.6\% or better, even when the Landsat 8 and CubeSat acquisitions were temporally displaced by {$>$}32\,days. The consistently high retrieval accuracies were achieved using a multi-scale target sampling scheme that draws Landsat 8 reference data from a series of scenes by using MODIS-consistent surface reflectance time series to quantify relative changes in Landsat-scale reflectances over given Landsat-CubeSat acquisition timespans. With the observing potential of Planet's CubeSats approaching daily nadir-pointing land surface imaging of the entire Earth, CESTEM offers the capacity to produce daily Landsat 8 consistent VNIR imagery with a factor of 10 increase in spatial resolution and with the radiometric quality of actual Landsat 8 observations.

  abstract = {Constellations of CubeSats are emerging as a novel observational resource with the potential to overcome the spatiotemporal constraints of conventional single-sensor satellite missions. With a constellation of more than 170 active CubeSats, Planet has realized daily global imaging in the RGB and near-infrared (NIR) at \textasciitilde 3 m resolution. While superior in terms of spatiotemporal resolution, the radiometric quality is not equivalent to that of larger conventional satellites. Variations in orbital configuration and sensor-specific spectral response functions represent an additional limitation. Here, we exploit a Cubesat Enabled Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Method (CESTEM) to optimize the utility and quality of very high-resolution CubeSat imaging. CESTEM represents a multipurpose data-driven scheme for radiometric normalization, phenology reconstruction, and spatiotemporal enhancement of biophysical properties via synergistic use of CubeSat, Landsat 8, and MODIS observations. Phenological reconstruction, based on original CubeSat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from top of atmosphere or surface reflectances, is shown to be susceptible to large uncertainties. In comparison, a CESTEM-corrected NDVI time series is able to clearly resolve several consecutive multicut alfalfa growing seasons over a six-month period, in addition to providing precise timing of key phenological transitions. CESTEM adopts a random forest machine-learning approach for producing Landsat-consistent leaf area index (LAI) at the CubeSat scale with a relative mean absolute difference on the order of 4\&ndash;6\%. The CubeSat-based LAI estimates highlight the spatial resolution advantage and capability to provide temporally consistent and time-critical insights into within-field vegetation dynamics, the rate of vegetation green-up, and the timing of harvesting events that are otherwise missed by 8- to 16-day Landsat imagery.},

Abstract: Planet Labs ("Planet") operate the largest fleet of active nano-satellites in orbit, offering an unprecedented monitoring capacity of daily and global RGB image capture at 3-5 m resolution. However, limitations in spectral resolution and lack of accurate radiometric sensor calibration impact the utility of this rich information source. In this study, Planet's RGB imagery was translated into a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): a common metric for vegetation growth and condition. Our framework employs a data mining approach to build a set of rule-based regression models that relate RGB data to atmospherically corrected Landsat-8 NDVI. The approach was evaluated over a desert agricultural landscape in Saudi Arabia where the use of near-coincident (within five days) Planet and Landsat-8 acquisitions in the training of the regression models resulted in NDVI predictabilities with an r2 of approximately 0.97 and a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) on the order of 0.014 (\textasciitilde 9\%). The MAD increased to 0.021 (\textasciitilde 14\%) when the Landsat NDVI training image was further away (i.e.; 11-16 days) from the corrected Planet image. In these cases, the use of MODIS observations to inform on the change in NDVI occurring between overpasses was shown to significantly improve prediction accuracies. MAD levels ranged from 0.002 to 0.011 (3.9\% to 9.1\%) for the best performing 80\% of the data. The technique is generic and extendable to any region of interest, increasing the utility of Planet's dense time-series of RGB imagery.},

Certain conditions found in abandoned fishponds, such as absence of fish and presence of aquatic vegetation, are conducive to the presence of malaria vectors. We conducted a district-wide fishpond census to determine the maintenance status and mosquito populations of fishponds in Kisii Central District in western Kenya. Two hundred and sixty one fishponds were found, 186 active (fish present) and 75 abandoned (fish absent). Vegetation was not significantly associated with the distribution of Anopheles gambiae s.l., Anopheles funestus or culicines (Diptera: Culicidae) in active or abandoned ponds. The presence of fish, however, correlated significantly with the distribution of all mosquito species, with significantly higher mosquito densities in abandoned fishponds. An. gambiae s.l. was the most abundant mosquito species found in both active and abandoned ponds, being proportionally more abundant in the abandoned ponds. The proportion of An. funestus increased with altitude. Following the census the demand for fish to re-stock abandoned ponds rose by 67\% when compared to the same time period in the previous year. This study highlights the potential public health problems associated with the abandonment of small-scale fish farming in the highlands of western Kenya.},

The sample-size- and coverage-based integrations of rarefaction (interpolation) and extrapolation (prediction) of Hill numbers represent a unified standardization method for quantifying and comparing species diversity across multiple assemblages. We briefly review the conceptual background of Hill numbers along with two approaches to standardization. We present an R package iNEXT (iNterpolation/EXTrapolation) which provides simple functions to compute and plot the seamless rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves for the three most widely used members of the Hill number family (species richness, Shannon diversity and Simpson diversity). Two types of biodiversity data are allowed: individual-based abundance data and sampling-unit-based incidence data. Several applications of the iNEXT packages are reviewed: (i) Non-asymptotic analysis: comparison of diversity estimates for equally large or equally complete samples. (ii) Asymptotic analysis: comparison of estimated asymptotic or true diversities. (iii) Assessment of sample completeness (sample coverage) across multiple samples. (iv) Comparison of estimated point diversities for a specified sample size or a specified level of sample coverage. Two examples are demonstrated, using the data (one for abundance data and the other for incidence data) included in the package, to illustrate all R functions and graphical displays.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Air travel has expanded at an unprecedented rate and continues to do so. Its effects have been seen on malaria in rates of imported cases, local outbreaks in non-endemic areas and the global spread of drug resistance. With elimination and global eradication back on the agenda, changing levels and compositions of imported malaria in malaria-free countries, and the threat of artemisinin resistance spreading from Southeast Asia, there is a need to better understand how the modern flow of air passengers connects each Plasmodium falciparum- and Plasmodium vivax-endemic region to the rest of the world. METHODS: Recently constructed global P. falciparum and P.vivax malaria risk maps, along with data on flight schedules and modelled passenger flows across the air network, were combined to describe and quantify global malaria connectivity through air travel. Network analysis approaches were then utilized to describe and quantify the patterns that exist in passenger flows weighted by malaria prevalence. Finally, the connectivity within and to the Southeast Asia region where the threat of imported artemisinin resistance arising is highest, was examined to highlight risk routes for its spread. RESULTS: The analyses demonstrate the substantial connectivity that now exists between and from malaria-endemic regions through air travel. While the air network provides connections to previously isolated malarious regions, it is clear that great variations exist, with significant regional communities of airports connected by higher rates of flow standing out. The structures of these communities are often not geographically coherent, with historical, economic and cultural ties evident, and variations between P. falciparum and P. vivax clear. Moreover, results highlight how well connected the malaria-endemic areas of Africa are now to Southeast Asia, illustrating the many possible routes that artemisinin-resistant strains could take. DISCUSSION: The continuing growth in air travel is playing an important role in the global epidemiology of malaria, with the endemic world becoming increasingly connected to both malaria-free areas and other endemic regions. The research presented here provides an initial effort to quantify and analyse the connectivity that exists across the malaria-endemic world through air travel, and provide a basic assessment of the risks it results in for movement of infections.},

With 1804 samples from 44 sites collected in western Kenya in 2012 and 2013, we performed resistance surface analysis to show that Lake Victoria acts as a barrier to transmission between areas north and south of the Winam Gulf. In addition, Mantel correlograms clearly showed significant correlations between genetic and geographic distance over short distances (less than 70\,km). In both cases, we used an identity-by-state measure of relatedness tailored to find highly related individual parasites in order to focus on recent gene flow that is more relevant to disease transmission. To supplement these results, we performed conventional population genetics analyses, including Bayesian clustering methods and spatial ordination techniques. These analyses revealed some differentiation on the basis of geography and elevation and a cluster of genetic similarity in the lowlands north of the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria. Taken as a whole, these results indicate low overall genetic differentiation in the Lake Victoria region, but with some separation of parasite populations north and south of the Winam Gulf that is explained by the presence of the lake as a geographic barrier to gene flow. We recommend similar landscape genetics analyses in future molecular epidemiology studies of vector-borne diseases to extend and contextualize the results of traditional population genetics.},

Stormwater management seeks to prevent these negative impacts with treatment structures and development strategies known collectively as stormwater best management practices (BMPs). However, it is difficult to predict the effectiveness of a system of BMPs prior to construction without modeling, which can be time-consuming. This study seeks to model relevant BMPs to inform the decision-making of water quality managers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland, USA. The standard of ideal performance in stormwater management is completely replicating pre-development hydrological conditions, and so these conditions were also modeled as a standard for success. During various modeled storm events, both peak discharge and total runoff volume were reduced by the BMPs relative to current conditions but remained substantially higher than predicted pre-development conditions. BMPs that significantly exceed the Maryland sizing criteria were then modeled, and these replicated pre-development hydrological conditions. These results indicate that, in this case, effective stormwater management requires implementation of management strategies beyond those required by government regulations, supported by site-specific information and performance evaluations.},

Several data types can be used to inform transmission network inferences, yet the sensitivity of those inferences to different data types is not routinely evaluated. METHODS: The influence of different combinations of spatial, temporal, and travel-history data on transmission network inferences for Plasmodium falciparum malaria were evaluated. RESULTS: The information content of these data types may be limited for inferring person-to-person transmission networks and may lead to an overestimate of transmission. Only when outbreaks were temporally focal or travel histories were accurate was the algorithm able to accurately estimate the reproduction number under control, Rc. Applying this approach to data from Eswatini indicated that inferences of Rc and spatiotemporal patterns therein depend upon the choice of data types and assumptions about travel-history data. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that transmission network inferences made with routine malaria surveillance data should be interpreted with caution.},

New models are developed for the structure program, both for the cases of admixture and no admixture. These models work by modifying the prior distribution for each individual's population assignment. The new prior distributions allow the proportion of individuals assigned to a particular cluster to vary by location. The models are tested on simulated data, and illustrated using microsatellite data from the CEPH Human Genome Diversity Panel. We demonstrate that the new models allow structure to be detected at lower levels of divergence, or with less data, than the original structure models or principal components methods, and that they are not biased towards detecting structure when it is not present. These models are implemented in a new version of structure which is freely available online at http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/structure.html.},

Herein, short-read sequencing approaches are represented by the most prevalent technologies, Illumina and Ion Torrent, and long-read sequencing approaches are represented by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore technologies. All technologies are reviewed along with reported advantages and disadvantages. Until recently, short-read sequencing was thought to provide high accuracy limited by read-length, while long-read technologies afforded much longer read-lengths at the expense of accuracy. Emerging developments for third-generation technologies hold promise for the next wave of sequencing evolution, with the co-existence of longer read lengths and high accuracy.},

We confirmed previous reports of high genomic diversity in P. vivax relative to the more virulent Plasmodium falciparum species; regional populations of P. vivax exhibited greater diversity than the global P. falciparum population, indicating a large and/or stable population. Signals of natural selection suggest that P. vivax is evolving in response to antimalarial drugs and is adapting to regional differences in the human host and the mosquito vector. These findings underline the variable epidemiology of this parasite species and highlight the breadth of approaches that may be required to eliminate P. vivax globally.},

  abstract = {Transmission intensity, movement of human and vector hosts, biogeographical features, and malaria control measures are some of the important factors that determine Plasmodium falciparum parasite genetic variability and population structure. Kenya has different malaria ecologies which might require different disease intervention methods. Refined parasite population genetic studies are critical for informing malaria control and elimination strategies. This study describes the genetic diversity and population structure of P. falciparum parasites from the different malaria ecological zones in Kenya. Twelve multi-locus microsatellite (MS) loci previously described were genotyped in 225 P. falciparum isolates collected between 2012 and 2013 from five sites; three in lowland endemic regions (Kisumu, Kombewa, and Malindi) and two in highland, epidemic regions (Kisii and Kericho). Parasites from the lowland endemic and highland epidemic regions of western Kenya had high genetic diversity compared to coastal lowland endemic region of Kenya [Malindi]. The Kenyan parasites had a mean genetic differentiation index (FST) of 0.072 (p=0.011). The multi-locus genetic analysis of the 12 MS revealed all the parasites had unique haplotypes. Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed in all the five parasite populations. Kisumu had the most significant index of association values (0.16; p{$<$}0.0001) whereas Kisii had the least significant index of association values (0.03; p{$<$}0.0001). Our data suggest high genetic diversity in Kenyan parasite population with the exception of parasite from Malindi where malaria has been on the decline. The presence of significant LD suggests that there is occurrence of inbreeding in the parasite population. Parasite populations from Kisii showed the strongest evidence for epidemic population structure whereas the rest of the regions showed panmixia. Defining the genetic diversity of the parasites in different ecological regions of Kenya after introduction of the artemether-lumefantrine is important in refining the spread of drug resistant strains and malaria transmission for more effective control and eventual elimination of malaria in Kenya.},

Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true.

This is particularly true for vector-borne diseases because vector populations can be strongly affected by host distribution as well as by climatic and landscape variables. Here, we aim to identify environmental drivers for bluetongue virus (BTV), the causative agent of a major vector-borne disease of ruminants that has emerged multiple times in Europe in recent decades. In order to determine the importance of climatic, landscape and host-related factors affecting BTV diffusion across Europe, we fitted different phylogeographic models to a dataset of 113 time-stamped and geo-referenced BTV genomes, representing multiple strains and serotypes. Diffusion models using continuous space revealed that terrestrial habitat below 300 m altitude, wind direction and higher livestock densities were associated with faster BTV movement. Results of discrete phylogeographic analysis involving generalized linear models broadly supported these findings, but varied considerably with the level of spatial partitioning. Contrary to common perception, we found no evidence for average temperature having a positive effect on BTV diffusion, though both methodological and biological reasons could be responsible for this result. Our study provides important insights into the drivers of BTV transmission at the landscape scale that could inform predictive models of viral spread and have implications for designing control strategies.},

  abstract = {Extensive peatlands in Indonesia are a major store of carbon. Deforestation, conversion to other land uses, especially plantations of oil palm and pulpwood trees, and recurrent fires have recently caused the release of large amounts of this carbon to the atmosphere. If these large emissions from degrading peatlands are taken into account Indonesia is one of the largest emitters of CO2 worldwide. To improve estimates of the amount of carbon stored in Indonesian peatlands we applied 3D modelling based on the combined analysis of satellite imagery (Landsat ETM+, SRTM) and 750 in situ peat thickness measurements. We demonstrate that SRTM radar data can be used to determine the extent and topography of the dome shaped surface of a selection of peatlands in Central Kalimantan, South Sumatra and West Papua. A strong correlation was obtained between the convex peat dome surface and the underlying mineral ground, which was used to calculate the peat volume and carbon store. Conservatively, we estimate that at least 55 ± 10~Gt of carbon are stored in Indonesia's peatlands. This amount is higher than previous results published because it takes into account the biconvex nature of the tropical peatlands. With this huge carbon storage and the current rate of degradation the tropical peatlands of Indonesia have the power to negatively influence the global climate. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {© 2016 by the authors. Remote sensing offers a low-cost method for developing spatially continuous crop production statistics across large areas and through time. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to characterize the production of individual smallholder farms, given that the land-holding size in most areas of South Asia ({$<$}2 ha) is smaller than the spatial resolution of most freely available satellite imagery, like Landsat and MODIS. In addition, existing methods to map yield require field-level data to develop and parameterize predictive algorithms that translate satellite vegetation indices to yield, yet these data are costly or difficult to obtain in many smallholder systems. To overcome these challenges, this study explores two issues. First, we employ new high spatial (2 m) and temporal (bi-weekly) resolution micro-satellite SkySat data to map sowing dates and yields of smallholder wheat fields in Bihar, India in the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 growing seasons. Second, we compare how well we predict sowing date and yield when using ground data, like crop cuts and self-reports, versus using crop models, which require no on-the-ground data, to develop and parameterize prediction models. Overall, sow dates were predicted well (R2 = 0.41 in 2014-2015 and R2 = 0.62 in 2015-2016), particularly when using models that were parameterized using self-report sow dates collected close to the time of planting and when using imagery that spanned the entire growing season. We were also able to map yields fairly well (R2 = 0.27 in 2014-2015 and R2 = 0.33 in 2015-2016), with crop cut parameterized models resulting in the highest accuracies. While less accurate, we were able to capture the large range in sow dates and yields across farms when using models parameterized with crop model data and these estimates were able to detect known relationships between management factors (e.g., sow date, fertilizer, and irrigation) and yield. While these results are specific to our study site in India, it is likely that the methods employed and the lessons learned are applicable to smallholder systems more generally across the globe. This is of particular interest given that similar high spatio-temporal resolution micro-satellite data will become increasingly available in the coming years.},

  abstract = {With significant declines in malaria, infections are increasingly clustered in households, or groups of households where malaria transmission is higher than in surrounding household/villages. To decrease transmission in such cases, reactive interventions target household members of clinical malaria cases, with the intervention unit (e.g., the "household/s") derived from an epidemiological and operational perspective. A lack of unanimity regarding the spatial range of the intervention unit calls for greater importance to be placed on social context in conceptualizing the appropriate unit. A novel malaria elimination strategy based on reactive treatment was recently evaluated by a cluster randomized trial in a low transmission setting in The Gambia. Transdisciplinary research was used to assess and improve the effectiveness of the intervention which consisted, among others, of reflecting on whether the household was the most adequate unit of analysis. The intervention was piloted on the smallest treatment unit possible and was further adapted following a better understanding of the social and epidemiological context. Intervention units defined according to (i) shared sleeping spaces and (ii) household membership, showed substantial limitations as it was not possible to define them clearly and they were extremely variable within the study setting. Incorporating local definitions and community preference in the trial design led to the appropriate intervention unit-the compound-defined as an enclosed space containing one or several households belonging to the same extended patrilineal family. Our study demonstrates the appropriateness of using transdisciplinary research for investigating alternative intervention units that are better tailored to reactive treatment approaches.},

The initial GWA scan included 2,500 children genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K GeneChip, and a replication study included 3,400 children. We used this to examine the performance of GWA methods in Africa. We found considerable population stratification, and also that signals of association at known malaria resistance loci were greatly attenuated owing to weak linkage disequilibrium (LD). To investigate possible solutions to the problem of low LD, we focused on the HbS locus, sequencing this region of the genome in 62 Gambian individuals and then using these data to conduct multipoint imputation in the GWA samples. This increased the signal of association, from P = 4 × 10(-7) to P = 4 × 10(-14), with the peak of the signal located precisely at the HbS causal variant. Our findings provide proof of principle that fine-resolution multipoint imputation, based on population-specific sequencing data, can substantially boost authentic GWA signals and enable fine mapping of causal variants in African populations.},

The viruses in this genus are the only plant-infecting members of the Bunyaviridae. A distinguishing feature, of tospoviruses, from other persistent–propagative plant viruses is that acquisition from infected host plants only occurs by larvae of thrips species. This transmission characteristic is modelled generically as acquisition by juveniles, an invasion threshold is derived, and the dynamics of the system are compared with systems where adults only are involved in acquisition and inoculation. The comparison suggests that in the model disease develops faster and to a greater extent where adults are involved in both acquisition and inoculation. In that case, mobile non-viruliferous adults visit infected plants to acquire virus and in turn visit healthy plants to inoculate virus, whereas acquisition by non-mobile juveniles depends firstly on eggs being laid on an infected plant and then on the virus passaging trans-stadially from the juvenile to the mobile adult form: other factors being equal, the greater the mobility of vectors the greater the probability of both acquisition and inoculation. Where acquisition is by both juvenile and adult forms of the vector, the derived invasion threshold is simply the sum of the component thresholds for each life stage; however, there may be a fitness cost on combining these characteristics expressed as a trade-off between optimising the life history parameters involved in each acquisition route.},

  abstract = {Much of the population in the developing world resides in rural areas, is dependent on local agriculture for survival, and thus directly subject to increasingly volatile and variable climatic patterns. Poverty limits options for adaptation to unpredictable weather and resultant food insecurity; these concerns are particularly salient in an era of climate change, which threatens to roll back years of development gains. Examining the association between the growing environment and child survival and nutrition is important in this context. Using NASA's satellite remote sensing data with Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from four West African countries (Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Benin), we assess the association between a climate-related environmental variable (vegetation index - NDVI) and child survival and nutrition. NDVI had a positive association with child survival and nutrition in countries with a wide distribution of NDVI values. NDVI was more likely to be positively associated with wasting rather than stunting. We find that environmental factors can be important for child survival and nutrition outcomes in specific contexts. Additional research is needed to further explore the ways NDVI can be used to inform our understanding of the environment's impact on child survival and nutrition.},

  abstract = {Worldwide increases in human and wildlife diseases have challenged ecologists to understand how large-scale environmental changes affect host-parasite interactions. One of the most profound changes to Earth's ecosystems is the alteration of global nutrient cycles, including those of phosphorus (P) and especially nitrogen (N). Along with the obvious direct benefits of nutrient application for food production, anthropogenic inputs of N and P can indirectly affect the abundance of infectious and noninfectious pathogens. The mechanisms underpinning observed correlations, however, and how such patterns vary with disease type, have long remained conjectural. Here, we highlight recent experimental advances to critically evaluate the relationship between environmental nutrient enrichment and disease. Given the interrelated nature of human and wildlife disease emergence, we include a broad range of human and wildlife examples from terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems. We examine the consequences of nutrient pollution on directly transmitted, vector-borne, complex life cycle, and noninfectious pathogens, including West Nile virus, malaria, harmful algal blooms, coral reef diseases, and amphibian malformations. Our synthetic examination suggests that the effects of environmental nutrient enrichment on disease are complex and multifaceted, varying with the type of pathogen, host species and condition, attributes of the ecosystem, and the degree of enrichment; some pathogens increase in abundance whereas others decline or disappear. Nevertheless, available evidence indicates that ecological changes associated with nutrient enrichment often exacerbate infection and disease caused by generalist parasites with direct or simple life cycles. Observed mechanisms include changes in host/vector density, host distribution, infection resistance, pathogen virulence or toxicity, and the direct supplementation of pathogens. Collectively, these pathogens may be particularly dangerous because they can continue to cause mortality even as their hosts decline, potentially leading to sustained epidemics or chronic pathology. We suggest that interactions between nutrient enrichment and disease will become increasingly important in tropical and subtropical regions, where forecasted increases in nutrient application will occur in an environment rich with infectious pathogens. We emphasize the importance of careful disease management in conjunction with continued intensification of global nutrient cycles.},

  abstract = {Background The dramatic progress in sequencing technologies offers unprecedented prospects for deciphering the organization of natural populations in space and time. However, the size of the datasets generated also poses some daunting challenges. In particular, Bayesian clustering algorithms based on pre-defined population genetics models such as the STRUCTURE or BAPS software may not be able to cope with this unprecedented amount of data. Thus, there is a need for less computer-intensive approaches. Multivariate analyses seem particularly appealing as they are specifically devoted to extracting information from large datasets. Unfortunately, currently available multivariate methods still lack some essential features needed to study the genetic structure of natural populations. Results We introduce the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), a multivariate method designed to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals. When group priors are lacking, DAPC uses sequential K-means and model selection to infer genetic clusters. Our approach allows extracting rich information from genetic data, providing assignment of individuals to groups, a visual assessment of between-population differentiation, and contribution of individual alleles to population structuring. We evaluate the performance of our method using simulated data, which were also analyzed using STRUCTURE as a benchmark. Additionally, we illustrate the method by analyzing microsatellite polymorphism in worldwide human populations and hemagglutinin gene sequence variation in seasonal influenza. Conclusions Analysis of simulated data revealed that our approach performs generally better than STRUCTURE at characterizing population subdivision. The tools implemented in DAPC for the identification of clusters and graphical representation of between-group structures allow to unravel complex population structures. Our approach is also faster than Bayesian clustering algorithms by several orders of magnitude, and may be applicable to a wider range of datasets.},

In particular, genetic data coupled with dates and locations of sampled isolates can be used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of pathogens during outbreaks. Thus far, phylogenetic methods have been used to tackle this issue. Although these approaches have proved useful for informing on the spread of pathogens, they do not aim at directly reconstructing the underlying transmission tree. Instead, phylogenetic models infer most recent common ancestors between pairs of isolates, which can be inadequate for densely sampled recent outbreaks, where the sample includes ancestral and descendent isolates. In this paper, we introduce a novel method based on a graph approach to reconstruct transmission trees directly from genetic data. Using simulated data, we show that our approach can efficiently reconstruct genealogies of isolates in situations where classical phylogenetic approaches fail to do so. We then illustrate our method by analyzing data from the early stages of the swine-origin A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. Using 433 isolates sequenced at both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, we reconstruct the likely history of the worldwide spread of this new influenza strain. The presented methodology opens new perspectives for the analysis of genetic data in the context of disease outbreaks.},

Recent developments in ecological-based network methods have created active research interest in areas such as animal behaviour, community ecology, and landscape connectivity. With the increasing availability of genetic data from wild populations, network analysis has become a viable and important method for the study of both between and within population genetics. However, to date there is a lack of cohesion in the methodology and terminology used in genetic networks, making it difficult for researchers to undertake network analysis or follow field-specific best practices. Here, we conducted a literature review of studies that use genetic-based networks to describe and analyse population structure, genetic connectivity, dispersal, and to understand individual level of genetic relatedness. We categorise studies as population-level networks and individual-based genetic networks, based on their node definition, and discuss the commonalities and differences between these approaches. Additionally, we present an overview of the current methods and software available for the construction and analysis of genetic networks. Lastly, we discuss how genetic networks can effectively contribute to the field of conservation biology, with particular focus on defining population structure/units, understanding genetic connectivity, dispersal, and detecting source/sink dynamics, as well as addressing how genetic networks can aid studies of individual or familial fitness and understanding population inbreeding and bottlenecks.},

  abstract = {G ST and its relatives are often interpreted as measures of differentiation between subpopulations, with values near zero supposedly indicating low differentiation. However, GST necessarily approaches zero when gene diversity is high, even if subpopulations are completely differentiated, and it is not monotonic with increasing differentiation. Likewise, when diversity is equated with heterozygosity, standard similarity measures formed by taking the ratio of mean within-subpopulation diversity to total diversity necessarily approach unity when diversity is high, even if the subpopulations are completely dissimilar (no shared alleles). None of these measures can be interpreted as measures of differentiation or similarity. The derivations of these measures contain two subtle misconceptions which cause their paradoxical behaviours. Conclusions about population differentiation, gene flow, relatedness, and conservation priority will often be wrong when based on these fixation indices or similarity measures. These are not statistical issues; the problems persist even when true population frequencies are used in the calculations. Recent advances in the mathematics of diversity identify the misconceptions, and yield mathematically consistent descriptive measures of population structure which eliminate the paradoxes produced by standard measures. These measures can be directly related to the migration and mutation rates of the finite-island model.},

Currently, biologists analyzing SNP information sometimes have to discard mixed infection samples as many downstream analyses require monogenomic inputs. Such a protocol impedes our understanding of the underlying genetic diversity, co-infection patterns, and genomic relatedness of pathogens. A scalable tool to learn and resolve the SNP-haplotypes from polygenomic data is an urgent need in molecular epidemiology. RESULTS: We develop a slice sampling Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, named SNP-Slice, to learn not only the SNP-haplotypes of all strains in the populations but also which strains infect which hosts. Our method reconstructs SNP-haplotypes and individual heterozygosities accurately without reference panels and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods at estimating the multiplicity of infections and allele frequencies. Thus, SNP-Slice introduces a novel approach to address polygenomic data and opens a new avenue for resolving complex infection patterns in molecular surveillance. We illustrate the performance of SNP-Slice on empirical malaria and HIV datasets and provide recommendations for using our method on empirical datasets.

This is not appropriate if the taxa have been densely sampled across evolutionary time and may be in a direct ancestral relationship, or if there is not enough information to fully resolve all the branching points in the evolutionary tree. In this article, we present a fast distance-based agglomeration method called family-joining (FJ) for constructing so-called generally labeled trees in which taxa may be placed at internal vertices and the tree may contain polytomies. FJ constructs such trees on the basis of pairwise distances and a distance threshold. We tested three methods for threshold selection, FJ-AIC, FJ-BIC, and FJ-CV, which minimize Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and cross-validation error, respectively. When compared with related methods on simulated data, FJ-BIC was among the best at reconstructing the correct tree across a wide range of simulation scenarios. FJ-BIC was applied to HIV sequences sampled from individuals involved in a known transmission chain. The FJ-BIC tree was found to be compatible with almost all transmission events. On average, internal branches in the FJ-BIC tree have higher bootstrap support than branches in the leaf-labeled bifurcating tree constructed using RAxML. 36\% and 25\% of the internal branches in the FJ-BIC tree and RAxML tree, respectively, have bootstrap support greater than 70\%. To the best of our knowledge the method presented here is the first attempt at modeling evolutionary relationships using generally labeled trees.},

However, few studies have investigated the use of routine health facility data in the more stable, endemic areas of Africa as a low-cost strategy to identify hotspots. Here the objective was to explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of fever positive rapid diagnostic test (RDT) malaria cases routinely collected along the Kenyan Coast. METHODS: Data on fever positive RDT cases between March 2018 and February 2019 were obtained from patients presenting to six out-patients health-facilities in a rural area of Kilifi County on the Kenyan Coast. To quantify spatial clustering, homestead level geocoded addresses were used as well as aggregated homesteads level data at enumeration zone. Data were sub-divided into quarterly intervals. Kulldorff's spatial scan statistics using Bernoulli probability model was used to detect hotspots of fever positive RDTs across all ages, where cases were febrile individuals with a positive test and controls were individuals with a negative test. RESULTS: Across 12~months of surveillance, there were nine significant clusters that were identified using the spatial scan statistics among RDT positive fevers. These clusters included 52\% of all fever positive RDT cases detected in 29\% of the geocoded homesteads in the study area. When the resolution of the data was aggregated at enumeration zone (village) level the hotspots identified were located in the same areas. Only two of the nine hotspots were temporally stable accounting for 2.7\% of the homesteads and included 10.8\% of all fever positive RDT cases detected. CONCLUSION: Taking together the temporal instability of spatial hotspots and the relatively modest fraction of the malaria cases that they account for; it would seem inadvisable to re-design the sub-county control strategies around targeting hotspots.},

  abstract = {Although bacteria from the genus Collimonas have demonstrated in vitro antifungal activity against many different fungi, they appeared inactive against the plant-pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (Forl), the causal agent of tomato foot and root rot (TFRR). Visualization studies using fluorescently labelled organisms showed that bacterial cells attached extensively to the fungal hyphae under nutrient-poor conditions but not in glucose-rich Armstrong medium. Collimonas fungivorans was shown to be as efficient in colonizing tomato root tips as the excellent colonizer Pseudomonas fluorescens strain WCS365. Furthermore, it appeared to colonize the same sites on the root as did the phytopathogenic fungus. Under greenhouse conditions in potting soil, C. fungivorans performed as well in biocontrol of TFRR as the well-established biocontrol strains P. fluorescens WCS365 and Pseudomonas chlororaphis PCL1391. Moreover, under biocontrol conditions, C. fungivorans did not attach to Forl hyphae colonizing plant roots. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that C. fungivorans mainly controls TFRR through a mechanism of competition for nutrients and niches rather than through its reported mycophagous properties, for which attachment of the bacteria to the fungal hyphae is assumed to be important.},

We developed the R package poppr providing unique tools for analysis of data from admixed, clonal, mixed, and/or sexual populations. Currently, poppr can be used for dominant/codominant and haploid/diploid genetic data. Data can be imported from several formats including GenAlEx formatted text files and can be analyzed on a user-defined hierarchy that includes unlimited levels of subpopulation structure and clone censoring. New functions include calculation of Bruvo's distance for microsatellites, batch-analysis of the index of association with several indices of genotypic diversity, and graphing including dendrograms with bootstrap support and minimum spanning networks. While functions for genotypic diversity and clone censoring are specific for clonal populations, several functions found in poppr are also valuable to analysis of any populations. A manual with documentation and examples is provided. Poppr is open source and major releases are available on CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org/package=poppr.

Results were compared with Illumina-based whole-genome sequence analysis that provides the most detailed sequence information but is cost-prohibitive. These adaptable, simple, and inexpensive methods can be easily implemented into routine genotyping of P. falciparum parasites in both laboratory and field settings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Passive surveillance of malaria in health facilities remains vital for implementation of control and elimination programs. It is therefore essential understanding current age profile of clinical malaria morbidity, mortality and presentations in areas with variant infection susceptibility. This study aimed at understanding the current malaria morbidity and mortality in Western Kenya. METHODS: Surveillance of clinical and asymptomatic parasitological positivity rates of all malaria suspected patients and school children were respectively determined from June 2015 to August 2016. From 2014 to 2016, register books in hospitals were referred and the confirmed malaria cases in conjunction with total number of monthly outpatient visits (OPD) counted. All registered malaria admissions were counted together with other causes of admissions. Moreover, outcome of malaria admissions in terms of discharge or death was recorded using inpatient charts within the same time frame. Prospective surveillance of severe malaria collected information on clinical features of the disease. Giemsa stained blood slides confirmed existence of malaria parasitemia. Chi-square and analysis of variance tests were used, respectively, to compute proportions and means; then a comparison was made between different age groups, periods, and study areas. RESULTS: During the survey of asymptomatic infections among school children, overall blood slide positivity ranged from 6.4\% at the epidemic prone site to 38.3\% at the hyperendemic site. During the clinical malaria survey, school age children (5-14) presented with overall the highest (45\%) blood slide positivity rate among those suspected to have the infection at the epidemic prone study site. The survey of all malaria confirmed and registered cases at OPD found 17\% to 27\% of all consultations among {$<$}5 children and 9.9\% to 20.7\% of all OPD visits among the ≥5 patients were due to malaria. Moreover, survey of all registered causes of admission in hospitals found 47\% of admissions were due to malaria. The disease was a major cause of admission in epidemic prone setting where 63.4\% of the {$<$}5 children and 62.8\% of the ≥5 patients were admitted due to malaria (p{$>$}0.05) and 40\% of all malaria admissions were school age children. Malaria related death rate was highest among {$<$}5 years at the hyperendemic site, that is 60.9 death per 1000 malaria {$<$}5 admissions. Conversely, the epidemic prone setting experienced highest malaria related death among ≥15 years (18.6 death per 1000 admissions) than the {$<$} 15 years (5.7 death per 1000 admissions of the {$<$}15 years) (p{$<$} 0.001). Surveillance of severe form of the disease found that hyperpyrexia, hyperparastemia, prostration and convulsions as common presentations of severe disease. CONCLUSION: Malaria is still the major cause of hospital consultations in Western Kenya with an alarming number of severe forms of the disease among the school aged children at the epidemic prone setting. Mortalities were higher among {$<$}5 children years in high infection transmission setting and among ≥15 years in low and moderate transmission settings. Surveillance of asymptomatic and symptomatic malaria along with evaluation of current interventions in different age groups should be implemented in Kenya.},

  abstract = {Molecular surveillance for malaria has great potential to support national malaria control programs (NMCPs). To bridge the gap between research and implementation, several applications (use cases) have been identified to align research, technology development, and public health efforts. For implementation at NMCPs, there is an urgent need for feasible and cost-effective tools. We designed a new highly multiplexed deep sequencing assay (Pf AmpliSeq), which is compatible with benchtop sequencers, that allows high-accuracy sequencing with higher coverage and lower cost than whole-genome sequencing (WGS), targeting genomic regions of interest. The novelty of the assay is its high number of targets multiplexed into one easy workflow, combining population genetic markers with 13 nearly full-length resistance genes, which is applicable for many different use cases. We provide the first proof of principle for hrp2 and hrp3 deletion detection using amplicon sequencing. Initial sequence data processing can be performed automatically, and subsequent variant analysis requires minimal bioinformatic skills using any tabulated data analysis program. The assay was validated using a retrospective sample collection (n\,=\,254) from the Peruvian Amazon between 2003 and 2018. By combining phenotypic markers and a within-country 28-single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) barcode, we were able to distinguish different lineages with multiple resistance haplotypes (in dhfr, dhps, crt and mdr1) and hrp2 and hrp3 deletions, which have been increasing in recent years. We found no evidence to suggest the emergence of artemisinin (ART) resistance in Peru. These findings indicate a parasite population that is under drug pressure but is susceptible to current antimalarials and demonstrate the added value of a highly multiplexed molecular tool to inform malaria strategies and surveillance systems. IMPORTANCE While the power of next-generation sequencing technologies to inform and guide malaria control programs has become broadly recognized, the integration of genomic data for operational incorporation into malaria surveillance remains a challenge in most countries where malaria is endemic. The main obstacles include limited infrastructure, limited access to high-throughput sequencing facilities, and the need for local capacity to run an in-country analysis of genomes at a large-enough scale to be informative for surveillance. In addition, there is a lack of standardized laboratory protocols and automated analysis pipelines to generate reproducible and timely results useful for relevant stakeholders. With our standardized laboratory and bioinformatic workflow, malaria genetic surveillance data can be readily generated by surveillance researchers and malaria control programs in countries of endemicity, increasing ownership and ensuring timely results for informed decision- and policy-making.},

  abstract = {Although the power of genetic surveillance tools has been acknowledged widely, there is an urgent need in malaria endemic countries for feasible and cost-effective tools to implement in national malaria control programs (NMCPs) that can generate evidence to guide malaria control and elimination strategies, especially in the case of Plasmodium vivax. Several genetic surveillance applications ('use cases') have been identified to align research, technology development, and public health efforts, requiring different types of molecular markers. Here we present a new highly-multiplexed deep sequencing assay (Pv AmpliSeq). The assay targets the 33-SNP vivaxGEN-geo panel for country-level classification, and a newly designed 42-SNP within-country barcode for analysis of parasite dynamics in Vietnam and 11 putative drug resistance genes in a highly multiplexed NGS protocol with easy workflow, applicable for many different genetic surveillance use cases. The Pv AmpliSeq assay was validated using: 1) isolates from travelers and migrants in Belgium, and 2) routine collections of the national malaria control program at sentinel sites in Vietnam. The assay targets 229 amplicons and achieved a high depth of coverage (mean 595.7 ± 481) and high accuracy (mean error-rate of 0.013 ± 0.007). P. vivax parasites could be characterized from dried blood spots with a minimum of 5 parasites/µL and 10\% of minority-clones. The assay achieved good spatial specificity for between-country prediction of origin using the 33-SNP vivaxGEN-geo panel that targets rare alleles specific for certain countries and regions. A high resolution for within-country diversity in Vietnam was achieved using the designed 42-SNP within-country barcode that targets common alleles (median MAF 0.34, range 0.01-0.49. Many variants were detected in (putative) drug resistance genes, with different predominant haplotypes in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt genes in different provinces in Vietnam. The capacity of the assay for high resolution identity-by-descent (IBD) analysis was demonstrated and identified a high rate of shared ancestry within Gia Lai Province in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, as well as between the coastal province of Binh Thuan and Lam Dong. Our approach performed well in geographically differentiating isolates at multiple spatial scales, detecting variants in putative resistance genes, and can be easily adjusted to suit the needs in other settings in a country or region. We prioritize making this tool available to researchers and NMCPs in endemic countries to increase ownership and ensure data usage for decision-making and malaria policy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is the most predominant malaria species in Latin America, constituting 71.5\% of malaria cases in 2021. With several countries aiming for malaria elimination, it is crucial to prioritize effectiveness of national control programs by optimizing the utilization of available resources and strategically implementing necessary changes. To support this, there is a need for innovative approaches such as genomic surveillance tools that can investigate changes in transmission intensity, imported cases and sources of reintroduction, and can detect molecular markers associated with drug resistance. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we apply a modified highly-multiplexed deep sequencing assay: Pv AmpliSeq v2 Peru. The tool targets a newly developed 41-SNP Peru barcode for parasite population analysis within Peru, the 33-SNP vivaxGEN-geo panel for country-level classification, and 11 putative drug resistance genes. It was applied to 230 samples from the Peruvian Amazon (2007-2020), generating baseline surveillance data. We observed a heterogenous P. vivax population with high diversity and gene flow in peri-urban areas of Maynas province (Loreto region) with a temporal drift using all SNPs detected by the assay (nSNP = 2909). In comparison, in an indigenous isolated area, the parasite population was genetically differentiated (FST = 0.07-0.09) with moderate diversity and high relatedness between isolates in the community. In a remote border community, a clonal P. vivax cluster was identified, with distinct haplotypes in drug resistant genes and ama1, more similar to Brazilian isolates, likely representing an introduction of P. vivax from Brazil at that time. To test its applicability for Latin America, we evaluated the SNP Peru barcode in P. vivax genomes from the region and demonstrated the capacity to capture local population clustering at within-country level. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together this data shows that P. vivax transmission is heterogeneous in different settings within the Peruvian Amazon. Genetic analysis is a key component for regional malaria control, offering valuable insights that should be incorporated into routine surveillance.},

The flight distance, the flight time, and individual flight activities of females were recorded during 22 h flight trials. The glycogen and lipid before flight, after flight, and of unflown controls were measured for starved, sugar-, or blood-fed females. Maximal flight distances of An. gambiae were 9 km when sugar-fed and 10 km when blood-fed, while in starved females it was below 3 km and the average speed was around 1 km/h. In Anopheles atroparvus, the maximal flight distances were 10-12 km when sugar-fed, 4.5 km when blood-fed, and below 3.5 km when starved, with an average speed of 1.3 km/h. Flight performances consisted of 1-4 h intervals of continuous flights, but mainly of bouts shorter than one h, randomly distributed during the long flight trials in both species. An. gambiae utilized an average of 47\% of its pre-flight carbohydrate reserves for survival and 38\% for flight at a rate of 0.07 cal/h/female. After a blood meal they utilized 11\% for survival and 61\% for flight at a rate of 0.04 cal/h. At the same time, 25\% of the pre-flight lipid was mobilized for flight at a rate of 0.09 cal/h when sugar-fed and 22\% when blood-fed at a rate of 0.06 cal/h; lipid was barely mobilized for survival. An. atroparvus differed: carbohydrate mobilization was 28\% for survival and 41\% for flight at a rate of 0.15 cal/h when sugar-fed; lipid mobilization for flight was only 13\% at a rate of 0.06 cal/h. After a blood meal only 2\% of the pre-flight lipid was used (0.02 cal/h). The contribution of carbohydrate reserves for flight metabolism at the high rate of 0.21 cal/h could not be fully elucidated because its decrease coincided with a pronounced resynthesis from the blood meal. An. atroparvus always depended on sugar meals for its flight activities and barely utilized lipid reserves. An. gambiae was independent of sugar sources for strong flights due to its early blood feeding and because of its equicaloric lipid mobilization during flights. Strong evidence for lipid oxidation during its flight is discussed.},

Emergence of PfART-R in Africa would result in a major public health problem. In this systematic review, we investigate the frequency and spatial distribution of Pfkelch13 mutants in Africa, including mutants linked to PfART-R in southeast Asia. Seven databases were searched (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, African Journal Online, African Index Medicus, Bioline, and Web of Science) for relevant articles about polymorphisms of the Pfkelch13 gene in Africa before January, 2019. Following PRISMA guidelines, 53 studies that sequenced the Pfkelch13 gene of 23 100 sample isolates in 41 sub-Saharan African countries were included. The Pfkelch13 sequence was highly polymorphic (292 alleles, including 255 in the Pfkelch13-propeller domain) but with mutations occurring at very low relative frequencies. Non-synonymous mutations were found in only 626 isolates (2·7\%) from west, central, and east Africa. According to WHO, nine different mutations linked to PfART-R in southeast Asia (Phe446Ile, Cys469Tyr, Met476Ile, Arg515Lys, Ser522Cys, Pro553Leu, Val568Gly, Pro574Leu, and Ala675Val) were detected, mainly in east Africa. Several other Pfkelch13 mutations, such as those structurally similar to southeast Asia PfART-R mutations, were also identified, but their relevance for drug resistance is still unknown. This systematic review shows that Africa, thought to not have established PfART-R, reported resistance-related mutants in the past 5 years. Surveillance using PfART-R molecular markers can provide valuable decision-making information to sustain the effectiveness of artemisinin in Africa.},

Signatures of selection were detected by cross-country comparisons with isolates from Thailand (n\,=\,104) and Indonesia (n\,=\,111), representing regions with low and high chloroquine resistance respectively. 26\% (35/137) of Ethiopian infections were polyclonal, and 48.5\% (17/35) of these comprised highly related clones (within-host identity-by-descent\,{$>$}\,25\%), indicating frequent co-transmission and superinfection. Parasite gene flow between districts could not be explained entirely by geographic distance, with economic and cultural factors hypothesised to have an impact on connectivity. Amplification of the duffy binding protein gene (pvdbp1) was prevalent across all districts (16-75\%). Cross-population haplotype homozygosity revealed positive selection in a region proximal to the putative chloroquine resistance transporter gene (pvcrt-o). An S25P variant in amino acid transporter 1 (pvaat1), whose homologue has recently been implicated in P. falciparum chloroquine resistance evolution, was prevalent in Ethiopia (96\%) but not Thailand or Indonesia (35-53\%). The genomic architecture in Ethiopia highlights circulating variants of potential public health concern in an endemic setting with evidence of stable transmission.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in sequencing allow population-genomic data to be generated for virtually any species. However, approaches to analyse such data lag behind the ability to generate it, particularly in nonmodel species. Linkage disequilibrium (LD, the nonrandom association of alleles from different loci) is a highly sensitive indicator of many evolutionary phenomena including chromosomal inversions, local adaptation and geographical structure. Here, we present linkage disequilibrium network analysis (LDna), which accesses information on LD shared between multiple loci genomewide. In LD networks, vertices represent loci, and connections between vertices represent the LD between them. We analysed such networks in two test cases: a new restriction-site-associated DNA sequence (RAD-seq) data set for Anopheles baimaii, a Southeast Asian malaria vector; and a well-characterized single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data set from 21 three-spined stickleback individuals. In each case, we readily identified five distinct LD network clusters (single-outlier clusters, SOCs), each comprising many loci connected by high LD. In A. baimaii, further population-genetic analyses supported the inference that each SOC corresponds to a large inversion, consistent with previous cytological studies. For sticklebacks, we inferred that each SOC was associated with a distinct evolutionary phenomenon: two chromosomal inversions, local adaptation, population-demographic history and geographic structure. LDna is thus a useful exploratory tool, able to give a global overview of LD associated with diverse evolutionary phenomena and identify loci potentially involved. LDna does not require a linkage map or reference genome, so it is applicable to any population-genomic data set, making it especially valuable for nonmodel species.},

In addition, there are challenges in measuring the type and frequency of resistant haplotypes in populations. This study presents a novel statistical method Gibbs sampler algorithm to investigate this issue. RESULTS: The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on simulated datasets consisting of patient blood samples characterized by their multiplicity of infection (MOI) and malaria genotype. The simulation used different resistance allele frequencies (RAF) at each Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and different limit of detection (LoD) of the SNPs and the MOI. The Gibbs sampler algorithm presents higher accuracy among high LoD of the SNPs or the MOI, validated, and deals with missing MOI compared to previous related statistical approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The Gibbs sampler algorithm provided robust results when faced with genotyping errors caused by LoDs and functioned well even in the absence of MOI data on individual patients.},

  abstract = {Plasmodium vivax malaria is a neglected tropical disease, despite being more geographically widespread than any other form of malaria. P. vivax was previously thought to be rare or absent in Africa because people of African descent often lack the Duffy blood group antigen, known as the Duffy antigen-chemokine receptor (DARC). DARC is a glycoprotein on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs) that allows P. vivax to bind and invade human erythrocytes. The documentation of P. vivax infections in different parts of Africa where Duffy-negative individuals are predominant suggested that there are alternative pathways for P. vivax to invade human erythrocytes. Duffy-negative individuals may be just as fit as Duffy-positive individuals and are no longer resistant to P. vivax malaria. The genetic characteristics and erythrocyte invasion mechanisms of P. vivax in Duffy-negative infections are largely unknown due to the less frequent occurrence in Africa and the complicated biology of P. vivax. My thesis research aims to investigate the genetic attributes of P. vivax in Duffy-negative individuals as compared to Duffy-positive individuals and identify alternative ligands for erythrocyte invasion through comparative transcriptomics and in vitro binding assays of major surface protein genes to clarify invasion functions. This research is critical for the development of new malaria intervention protocols and will assist in development of a stable P. vivax machine.},

No clear genetic differentiation was found in P. vivax between the 2 Duffy groups, indicating between-host transmission.

  abstract = {Global warming has serious implications for all aspects of human life, including infectious diseases. The effect of global warming depends on the complex interaction between the human host population and the causative infectious agent. From the human standpoint, changes in the environment may trigger human migration, causing disease patterns to shift. Crop failures and famine may reduce host resistance to infections. Disease transmission may be enhanced through the scarcity and contamination of potable water sources. Importantly, significant economic and political stresses may damage the existing public health infrastructure, leaving mankind poorly prepared for unexpected epidemics. Global warming will certainly affect the abundance and distribution of disease vectors. Altitudes that are currently too cool to sustain vectors will become more conducive to them. Some vector populations may expand into new geographic areas, whereas others may disappear. Malaria, dengue, plague, and viruses causing encephalitic syndromes are among the many vector-borne diseases likely to be affected. Some models suggest that vector-borne diseases will become more common as the earth warms, although caution is needed in interpreting these predictions. Clearly, global warming will cause changes in the epidemiology of infectious diseases. The ability of mankind to react or adapt is dependent upon the magnitude and speed of the change. The outcome will also depend on our ability to recognize epidemics early, to contain them effectively, to provide appropriate treatment, and to commit resources to prevention and research.},

  abstract = {Recent satellite missions have provided new perspectives by offering high spatial resolution, a variety of spectral properties, and fast revisit rates to the same regions. In this study, we examined the utility of both broadband red-edge spectral information and texture features for classifying paddy rice crops in South Korea into three different growth stages. The rice grown in South Korea can be grouped into early-maturing, medium-maturing, and medium-late-maturing cultivars, and each cultivar is known to have a minimum and maximum productivity. Therefore, the accurate classification of paddy rice crops into a certain time line enables pre-estimation of the expected rice yields. For the analysis, two seasons of RapidEye satellite image data were used. The results showed that the broadband red-edge information slightly improved the classification accuracy of the paddy rice crops, particularly when single-season image data were used. In contrast, texture information resulted in only minor improvement or even a slight decline in accuracy, although it is known to be advantageous for object-based classification. This was due to the homogeneous nature of paddy rice fields, as different rice cultivars are similar in terms of their morphology. Based on these results, we conclude that the additional spectral information such as the red-edge band is more useful than the texture features to detect different crop conditions in relatively homogeneous rice paddy environments. We therefore confirm the potential of broadband red-edge information to improve the classification of paddy rice crops. However, there is still a need to examine the relationship between textural properties and paddy rice crop parameters in greater depth.},

  abstract = {Climate change/variability is a major driving factor among others that contribute to the spread of suitable malaria vectors’ geographical extent. The current study employed comparative spatial–temporal analysis using bioclimatic envelope modeling to predict and quantify the possible surge of suitable malaria vectors’ habitats in new hotspots in Kenya. BIOCLIM and BIOCLIM True/False models were run with model data from HADCM3, CCCMA and SCIRO IPCC future climatic projections under A2a scenario. Prediction and projection of the malaria vectors’ prevalence and distribution were done for the whole country. Spatial–temporal models were generated for the baseline climate, and projections were done to depict how the vectors are likely to be distributed by the years 2020, 2050 and 2080 under the influence of climate change. The results showed that the highest suitable malaria vectors’ habitats by area was 227, 092 km2 obtained when prediction was done with HADCM3 future climate by the year 2050. The least suitable habitats by area was 80, 060 km2 which was predicted with CCCMA projection by the year 2050. Ecological niche prediction from HADCM3 and CSIRO showed a similar trend although at different magnitudes. The prediction results portrayed high likelihood of shift in some suitable habitats that could turn unsuitable, while new hotspots are likely to emerge. The BIOCLIM prediction with the three future climate models showed that the current endemic zones of the lake region and south coastal strip of the Indian Ocean will still remain suitable habitats but with a decline shift in spatial extent by the year 2020, then start to expand by the years 2050–2080. Predictions from HADCM3 by the year 2050 has shown possible wide spread of malaria spatial extents in counties like Narok, Kajiado, Kitui, Makueni, Machakos, Meru, Marsabit, Isiolo, Samburu, Baringo, West Pokot, Turkana and Mandera, while a few others of lower extent might have some emerging isolated hotspots. Laikipia County might become unsuitable habitat for malaria vectors by the year 2050, and the case may remain the same by the year 2080. The malaria burden is likely to shift from Laikipia to the neighboring counties of Baringo, Isiolo, Meru and Turkana. In conclusion, malaria vectors are likely to spread in new continuous and isolated hotspots with future likely increase in malaria prevalence hence possible epidemic upsurge by the year 2050. Consequently, evidence-based scientific research can be utilized to guide policy for sustainable development in the health agenda.},

We compare the modified versions with the original ones by measuring the false discovery rate in simulated whole-genome scans and by quantifying the overlap of inferred candidate regions in empirical data. We find that phasing information is indispensable for accurate estimation of within-population statistics (for all but very large samples) and of cross-population statistics for small samples. Ancestry information, in contrast, is of lesser importance for both types of statistic. Our publicly available R package rehh incorporates the modified statistics presented here.},

  abstract = {The elimination of Plasmodium vivax is challenged by dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) that can reactivate months after initial infection resulting in relapses that enhance transmission. Relapsing infections confound antimalarial clinical efficacy trials due to the inability to distinguish between recurrences arising from blood-stage treatment failure (recrudescence), reinfection or relapse. Genetic relatedness of paired parasite isolates, measured by identity-by-descent (IBD), can provide important information on whether individuals have had single or multiple mosquito inoculations, thus informing on recurrence origin. We developed a high-throughput amplicon sequencing assay comprising 93 multi-SNP (microhaplotype) P. vivax markers to determine IBD between P. vivax clinical isolates. The assay was evaluated in 659 independent infections from the Asia-Pacific and Horn of Africa, including 108 pairs of infections from a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A bioinformatics pipeline (vivaxGEN-MicroHaps) was established to support data processing. Simulations using paneljudge demonstrated low error in pairwise IBD estimation in all countries assessed (all RMSE {$<$}0.12) and IBD-based networks illustrated strong clustering by geography. IBD analysis in the RCT demonstrated a higher frequency of suspected relapses or recrudescence in patients treated with primaquine regimens (0.84) compared to those without primaquine (0.60). Our results demonstrate the potential to derive information on P. vivax IBD using amplicon sequencing, that informs policy-relevant treatment and transmission dynamics.},

However, surface inland water bodies can feature temporally rapid spatial changes caused by extreme events, seasonal variability as well as human activity. Such changes can occur on temporal scales which are below the currently existing dynamic water body products. While the daily temporal resolution of available sensors has not been exploited yet. In this study we present an approach which uses the full temporal resolution of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to generate a 250~m daily global dataset of inland water bodies based on spectral information and dynamic thresholding. Based on a combination of MODIS Terra and Aqua daily classifications, auxiliary mask layers and temporal interpolation, a global cloud and gap free time series of inland water bodies is produced. The presented results are validated with 321 Landsat images across the globe. The executed validation shows an overall accuracy of 96.3\% with 7.8\% omission and 0.5\% commission error, and a kappa coefficient of 93.3\% for pure water pixels. The presented results demonstrate the high potential for different applications requiring information of inland water body dynamics at high temporal resolution. Examples demonstrate that e.g. the filling and emptying of water reservoirs, changes and inundation cycles of natural water bodies as well as freezing and thawing of lakes can be analyzed at a highly detailed temporal scale.},

In this letter, we present an approach using dynamic threshold techniques and utilizing time series to generate a data set containing detected surface water bodies on a global scale with daily temporal resolution. Exemplary results for the year 2013 that were based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products are presented in this letter. The main input data sets for the presented product were MOD09GQ/MYD09GQ and MOD10A1/MYD10A1 with a spatial resolution of 250 m and 500 m, respectively. Using the static water mask MOD44W, we extracted training pixels to generate dynamic thresholds for individual data sets on daily basis. In a second processing step, the generated sequences of water masks were utilized to interpolate the results for any missing observations, either due to cloud coverage or missing data, as well as to reduce misclassification due to cloud shadow. The product provides an opportunity for further research and for assessing the drivers of changes of inland water bodies at a global scale.},

During the first phase of the study 27 small watersheds, having simila\textasciitilde c haracteristics but varied according to land use, were investigated. Using these controlled conditions, eliminating as many interferences as possible, this first phase was intended to determine if a definite relationship did exist between the two factors. Finding that the fust phase was successful the second was initiated which consisted of a comparison of biological sampling data, from other studies, with degree of watershed urbanization. The purpose of this second phase was to ascertain if the relationship between degrees of urbanization and decline in stream quality was linear as watershed area increased and in streams spread throughout the Maryland Piedmont. The principal finding of this study was that stream quality impairment is fust evidenced when watershed imperviousness reaches 12\%, but does not become severe until imperviousness reaches 30\%.},

To assist the research community, we report a software usability study in which 40 researchers across different disciplines prepared scholarly texts with either Microsoft Word or LaTeX. The probe texts included simple continuous text, text with tables and subheadings, and complex text with several mathematical equations. We show that LaTeX users were slower than Word users, wrote less text in the same amount of time, and produced more typesetting, orthographical, grammatical, and formatting errors. On most measures, expert LaTeX users performed even worse than novice Word users. LaTeX users, however, more often report enjoying using their respective software. We conclude that even experienced LaTeX users may suffer a loss in productivity when LaTeX is used, relative to other document preparation systems. Individuals, institutions, and journals should carefully consider the ramifications of this finding when choosing document preparation strategies, or requiring them of authors.},

Using a combination of genetic and epidemiological data we defined a malaria transmission unit as the area contributing 95\% of malaria cases diagnosed at the catchment facility located in the town of Guapi in the South Pacific Coast of Colombia. We provide data showing that P. falciparum malaria transmission is heterogeneous in time and space and analysed, using topological data analysis, the spatial connectivity, at the micro epidemiological level, between parasite populations circulating within the unit. To illustrate the necessity to evaluate the efficacy of malaria control measures within the transmission unit in order to increase the efficiency of the malaria control effort, we provide information on the size of the asymptomatic reservoir, the nature of parasite genotypes associated with drug resistance as well as the frequency of the Pfhrp2/3 deletion associated with false negatives when using Rapid Diagnostic Tests.},

The study was implemented in an area selected from Muratpasa district of Antalya, Turkey, which includes both glass and plastic greenhouses extensively. Overall, the computed classification accuracies are quite high using all classification techniques. However, the most accurate classification result was obtained using SVM classifier, with overall accuracy of 93.88\%. The performance of RF classification is slightly lower than SVM classification, with overall accuracy of 91.73\%. On the other hand, SVM and RF classifiers significantly outperformed ML classifier, providing higher overall accuracies. When plastic greenhouse detection accuracies are considered, the obtained results revealed that all of the used classification techniques are quite successful. However, for glass greenhouse detection, the SVM and RF classifiers provided significantly higher accuracies than ML. © 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: When both parasite species are co-endemic, Plasmodium vivax incidence peaks in younger children compared to P. falciparum. To identify differences in the number of blood stage infections of these species and its potential link to acquisition of immunity, we have estimated the molecular force of blood-stage infection of P. vivax ((mol)FOB, i.e. the number of genetically distinct blood-stage infections over time), and compared it to previously reported values for P. falciparum. METHODS: P. vivax (mol)FOB was estimated by high resolution genotyping parasites in samples collected over 16 months in a cohort of 264 Papua New Guinean children living in an area highly endemic for P. falciparum and P. vivax. In this cohort, P. vivax episodes decreased three-fold over the age range of 1-4.5 years. RESULTS: On average, children acquired 14.0 new P. vivax blood-stage clones/child/year-at-risk. While the incidence of clinical P. vivax illness was strongly associated with mol FOB (incidence rate ratio (IRR){$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.99, 95\% confidence interval (CI95) [1.80, 2.19]), (mol)FOB did not change with age. The incidence of P. vivax showed a faster decrease with age in children with high (IRR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.49, CI95 [0.38, 0.64] p{$<$}0.001) compared to those with low exposure (IRR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.63, CI95[0.43, 0.93] p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.02). CONCLUSION: P. vivax (mol)FOB is considerably higher than P. falciparum (mol)FOB (5.5 clones/child/year-at-risk). The high number of P. vivax clones that infect children in early childhood contribute to the rapid acquisition of immunity against clinical P. vivax malaria.},

To analyze patterns of microsatellite diversity and population structure across countries of different transmission intensity, genotyping data from 11 microsatellite markers was either generated or compiled from 841 isolates from four continents collected in 1999-2008. Diversity was highest in South-East Asia (mean allelic richness 10.0-12.8), intermediate in the South Pacific (8.1-9.9) Madagascar and Sudan (7.9-8.4), and lowest in South America and Central Asia (5.5-7.2). A reduced panel of only 3 markers was sufficient to identify approx. 90\% of all haplotypes in South Pacific, African and SE-Asian populations, but only 60-80\% in Latin American populations, suggesting that typing of 2-6 markers, depending on the level of endemicity, is sufficient for epidemiological studies. Clustering analysis showed distinct clusters in Peru and Brazil, but little sub-structuring was observed within Africa, SE-Asia or the South Pacific. Isolates from Uzbekistan were exceptional, as a near-clonal parasite population was observed that was clearly separated from all other populations (FST{$>$}0.2). Outside Central Asia FST values were highest (0.11-0.16) between South American and all other populations, and lowest (0.04-0.07) between populations from South-East Asia and the South Pacific. These comparisons between P. vivax populations from four continents indicated that not only transmission intensity, but also geographical isolation affect diversity and population structure. However, the high effective population size results in slow changes of these parameters. This persistency must be taken into account when assessing the impact of control programs on the genetic structure of parasite populations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Swaziland has made great progress towards its goal of malaria elimination by 2015. However, malaria importation from neighbouring high-endemic Mozambique through Swaziland's eastern border remains a major factor that could prevent elimination from being achieved. In order to reach elimination, Swaziland must rapidly identify and treat imported malaria cases before onward transmission occurs. METHODS: A nationwide formative assessment was conducted over eight weeks to determine if the imported cases of malaria identified by the Swaziland National Malaria Control Programme could be linked to broader social networks and to explore methods to access these networks. RESULTS: Using a structured format, interviews were carried out with malaria surveillance agents (6), health providers (10), previously identified imported malaria cases (19) and people belonging to the networks identified through these interviews (25). Most imported malaria cases were Mozambicans (63\%, 12/19) making a living in Swaziland and sustaining their families in Mozambique. The majority of imported cases (73\%, 14/19) were labourers and self-employed contractors who travelled frequently to Mozambique to visit their families and conduct business. Social networks of imported cases with similar travel patterns were identified through these interviews. Nearly all imported cases (89\%, 17/19) were willing to share contact information to enable network members to be interviewed. Interviews of network members and key informants revealed common congregation points, such as the urban market places in Manzini and Malkerns, as well as certain bus stations, where people with similar travel patterns and malaria risk behaviours could be located and tested for malaria. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that imported cases of malaria belonged to networks of people with similar travel patterns. This study may provide novel methods for screening high-risk groups of travellers using both snowball sampling and time-location sampling of networks to identify and treat additional malaria cases. Implementation of a proactive screening programme of importation networks may help Swaziland halt transmission and achieve malaria elimination by 2015.},

  abstract = {Urban development modifies the production and delivery of runoff to streams and the resulting rate, volume, and timing of streamflow. Given that streamflow demonstrably influences the structure and composition of lotic communities, we have identified four hydrologic changes result- ing from urban development that are potentially significant to stream ecosystems: increased fre- quency of high flows, redistribution of water from base flow to storm flow, increased daily variation in streamflow, and reduction in low flow. Previous investigations of streamflow patterns and biologi- cal assemblages provide a scale of ecological significance for each type of streamflow pattern. The scales establish the magnitude of changes in streamflow patterns that could be expected to produce biological responses in streams. Long-term streamflow records from eight streams in urbanizing areas of the United States and five additional reference streams, where land use has been relatively stable, were analyzed to assess if streamflow patterns were modified by urban development to an extent that a biological response could be expected and whether climate patterns could account for equivalent hydrologic variation in the reference streams. Changes in each type of streamflow pattern were evident in some but not all of the urban streams and were nearly absent in the reference streams. Given these results, hydrologic changes are likely significant to urban stream ecosystems, but the significance depends on the stream’s physiographic context and spatial and temporal patterns of urban development. In urban streams with substantially altered hydrology, short-term goals for urban stream rehabilitation may be limited because of the difficulty and expense of restoring hydro- logic processes in an urban landscape. The ecological benefits of improving physical habitat and water quality may be tempered by persistent effects of altered streamflow. In the end, the hydrologic effects of urban development must be addressed for restoration of urban streams.},

  abstract = {Spatially heterogeneous landscape factors such as urbanisation can have substantial effects on the severity and spread of wildlife diseases. However, research linking patterns of pathogen transmission to landscape features remains rare. Using a combination of phylogeographic and machine learning approaches, we tested the influence of landscape and host factors on feline immunodeficiency virus (FIVLru) genetic variation and spread among bobcats (Lynx rufus) sampled from coastal southern California. We found evidence for increased rates of FIVLru lineage spread through areas of higher vegetation density. Furthermore, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation among FIVLru sequences was associated with host genetic distances and geographic location, with FIVLru genetic discontinuities precisely correlating with known urban barriers to host dispersal. An effect of forest land cover on FIVLru SNP variation was likely attributable to host population structure and differences in forest land cover between different populations. Taken together, these results suggest that the spread of FIVLru is constrained by large-scale urban barriers to host movement. Although urbanisation at fine spatial scales did not appear to directly influence virus transmission or spread, we found evidence that viruses transmit and spread more quickly through areas containing higher proportions of natural habitat. These multiple lines of evidence demonstrate how urbanisation can change patterns of contact-dependent pathogen transmission and provide insights into how continued urban development may influence the incidence and management of wildlife disease.},

  abstract = {Landscape genetics has provided many insights into how heterogeneous landscape features drive processes influencing spatial genetic variation in free-living organisms. This rapidly developing field has focused heavily on vertebrates, and expansion of this scope to the study of infectious diseases holds great potential for landscape geneticists and disease ecologists alike. The potential application of landscape genetics to infectious agents has garnered attention at formative stages in the development of landscape genetics, but systematic examination is lacking. We comprehensively review how landscape genetics is being used to better understand pathogen dynamics. We characterize the field and evaluate the types of questions addressed, approaches used and systems studied. We also review the now established landscape genetic methods and their realized and potential applications to disease ecology. Lastly, we identify emerging frontiers in the landscape genetic study of infectious agents, including recent phylogeographic approaches and frameworks for studying complex multihost and host-vector systems. Our review emphasizes the expanding utility of landscape genetic methods available for elucidating key pathogen dynamics (particularly transmission and spread) and also how landscape genetic studies of pathogens can provide insight into host population dynamics. Through this review, we convey how increasing awareness of the complementarity of landscape genetics and disease ecology among practitioners of each field promises to drive important cross-disciplinary advances.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Malaria prevalence has declined in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania over the past 10\,years, particularly at lower altitudes. While this decline has been related to the scale-up of long-lasting insecticidal nets to achieve universal coverage targets, it has also been attributed to changes in environmental factors that are important for enabling and sustaining malaria transmission. OBJECTIVES: Herein, we apply spatial analytical approaches to investigate the impact of environmental and demographic changes, including changes in temperature, precipitation, land cover, and population density, on the range of the major malaria vector species Anopheles arabiensis in two districts of Tanzania, situated on the southern slope of Mount Kilimanjaro. These models are used to identify environmental changes that have occurred over a 10-year period and highlight the implications for malaria transmission in this highland region. METHODS: Entomological data were collected from the Hai and Lower Moshi districts of Tanzania in 2001-2004 and 2014-2015. Vector occurrence data were applied alongside satellite remote sensing indices of climate and land cover, and gridded population data, to develop species distribution models for An. arabiensis for the 2004 and 2014 periods using maximum entropy. Models were compared to assess the relative contribution of different environmental and demographic factors to observed trends in vector species distribution in lowland and highland areas. RESULTS: Changes in land cover were observed in addition to increased population densities, increased warm season temperature, and decreased wetness at low altitudes. The predicted area and extent of suitable habitat for An. arabiensis declined across the study area over the 10-year period, with notable contraction at lower altitudes, while species range in higher altitude zones expanded. Importantly, deforestation and warmer temperatures at higher altitudes may have created stable areas of suitable vector habitat in the highlands capable of sustaining malaria transmission. CONCLUSION: We show that environmental changes have had an important influence on the distribution of malaria vector species in a highland area of northern Tanzania. Highland areas may be at continued risk for sporadic malaria outbreaks despite the overall range contraction of principal vector species at lower altitudes, where malaria transmission remains at low intensity.},

  abstract = {Any study that examines the effects of area-based attributes on individual behaviors or outcomes faces another fundamental methodological problem besides the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). It is the problem that results about these effects can be affected by how contextual units or neighborhoods are geographically delineated and the extent to which these areal units deviate from the true geographic context. The problem arises because of the spatial uncertainty in the actual areas that exert the contextual influences under study and the temporal uncertainty in the timing and duration in which individuals experienced these contextual influences. Using neighborhood effects and environmental health research as a point of departure, this article clarifies the nature and sources of this problem, which is referred to as the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP). It highlights some of the inferential errors that the UGCoP might cause and discusses some means for mitigating the problem. It reviews recent studies to show that both contextual variables and research findings are sensitive to different delineations of contextual units. The article argues that the UGCoP is a problem as fundamental as the MAUP but is a different kind of problem. Future research needs to pay explicit attention to its potential confounding effects on research results and to methods for mitigating the problem.},

The book is divided into two distinct sections – floods and droughts – and offers a variety of techniques for monitoring each. With rapid advances in computer modelling and observing systems, floods and droughts are studied with greater precision today than ever before. Land surface models, especially over the entire Continental United States, can map the hydrological cycle at kilometre and sub-kilometre scales. In the case of smaller areas there is even higher spatial resolution and the only limiting factor is the resolution of input data. In-situ sensors are automated and the data is directly relayed to the world wide web for many hydrological variables such as precipitation, soil moisture, surface temperature and heat fluxes. In addition, satellite remote sensing has advanced to providing twice a day repeat observations at kilometre to ten-kilometre spatial scales. We are at a critical juncture in the study of hydrological extremes, and the GPM and SMAP missions as well as the MODIS and GRACE sensors give us more tools and data than were ever available before. A global variety of chapter authors provides wide-ranging perspectives and case studies that will make this book an indispensable resource for researchers, engineers, and even emergency management and insurance professionals who study and/or manage hydrological extremes.},

  abstract = {Modeling functional connectivity in altered landscapes is one of the growing fields of expertise in landscape ecology, and many research teams have proposed different methods to evaluate it for a wide range of species. However, very few have empirically validated the efficiency of such models in discriminating real corridors from theoretical ones. Models that are not validated or those only based on structural connectivity could result in inefficient management decisions. Moreover, validation could potentially reveal that functional connectivity differs between focal species and spatial scales. Here we empirically compared different validation methods for two commonly used connectivity models applied to two cervid species (i.e. moose Alces americanus and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus) during a road enlargement project. For both species, we built functional connectivity maps using CircuitScape (circuit-based model) and LinkageMapper (least-cost path model). We then validated them empirically using four different metrics: density of cervid-vehicle collisions, distance to the nearest wintering ground and detection rate calculated with automated cameras and with sand traps. Validation was carried out at various spatial scales (150, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500~m). The circuit-based models performed better at identifying functional corridors of connectivity for moose. Validation strength differed greatly between the four metrics used, and the spatial scale at which the correlation between connectivity and data was assessed had little effect. Our study emphasizes the importance of validating functional connectivity models to provide the best decision-making tools.},

We present a review of the key findings from eight case studies that we conducted in Europe and West Africa on the impact of land changes on emerging or re-emerging vector-borne diseases and/or zoonoses. The case studies concern West Nile virus transmission in Senegal, tick-borne encephalitis incidence in Latvia, sandfly abundance in the French Pyrenees, Rift Valley Fever in the Ferlo (Senegal), West Nile Fever and the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue, and rodent-borne Puumala hantavirus and Lyme borreliosis in Belgium. RESULTS: We identified general principles governing landscape epidemiology in these diverse disease systems and geographic regions. We formulated ten propositions that are related to landscape attributes, spatial patterns and habitat connectivity, pathways of pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts, scale issues, land use and ownership, and human behaviour associated with transmission cycles. CONCLUSIONS: A static view of the "pathogenecity" of landscapes overlays maps of the spatial distribution of vectors and their habitats, animal hosts carrying specific pathogens and their habitat, and susceptible human hosts and their land use. A more dynamic view emphasizing the spatial and temporal interactions between these agents at multiple scales is more appropriate. We also highlight the complementarity of the modelling approaches used in our case studies. Integrated analyses at the landscape scale allows a better understanding of interactions between changes in ecosystems and climate, land use and human behaviour, and the ecology of vectors and animal hosts of infectious agents.},

  abstract = {The influence of study design on the ability to detect the effects of landscape pattern on gene flow is one of the most pressing methodological gaps in landscape genetic research. To investigate the effect of study design on landscape genetics inference, we used a spatially-explicit, individual-based program to simulate gene flow in a spatially continuous population inhabiting a landscape with gradual spatial changes in resistance to movement. We simulated a wide range of combinations of number of loci, number of alleles per locus and number of individuals sampled from the population. We assessed how these three aspects of study design influenced the statistical power to successfully identify the generating process among competing hypotheses of isolation-by-distance, isolation-by-barrier, and isolation-by-landscape resistance using a causal modelling approach with partial Mantel tests. We modelled the statistical power to identify the generating process as a response surface for equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions after introduction of isolation-by-landscape resistance. All three variables (loci, alleles and sampled individuals) affect the power of causal modelling, but to different degrees. Stronger partial Mantel r correlations between landscape distances and genetic distances were found when more loci were used and when loci were more variable, which makes comparisons of effect size between studies difficult. Number of individuals did not affect the accuracy through mean equilibrium partial Mantel r, but larger samples decreased the uncertainty (increasing the precision) of equilibrium partial Mantel r estimates. We conclude that amplifying more (and more variable) loci is likely to increase the power of landscape genetic inferences more than increasing number of individuals.},

  abstract = {Understanding how spatial genetic patterns respond to landscape change is crucial for advancing the emerging field of landscape genetics. We quantified the number of generations for new landscape barrier signatures to become detectable and for old signatures to disappear after barrier removal. We used spatially explicit, individual-based simulations to examine the ability of an individual-based statistic [Mantel's r using the proportion of shared alleles' statistic (Dps)] and population-based statistic (FST ) to detect barriers. We simulated a range of movement strategies including nearest neighbour dispersal, long-distance dispersal and panmixia. The lag time for the signal of a new barrier to become established is short using Mantel's r (1-15 generations). FST required approximately 200 generations to reach 50\% of its equilibrium maximum, although G'ST performed much like Mantel's r. In strong contrast, FST and Mantel's r perform similarly following the removal of a barrier formerly dividing a population. Also, given neighbour mating and very short-distance dispersal strategies, historical discontinuities from more than 100 generations ago might still be detectable with either method. This suggests that historical events and landscapes could have long-term effects that confound inferences about the impacts of current landscape features on gene flow for species with very little long-distance dispersal. Nonetheless, populations of organisms with relatively large dispersal distances will lose the signal of a former barrier within less than 15 generations, suggesting that individual-based landscape genetic approaches can improve our ability to measure effects of existing landscape features on genetic structure and connectivity.},

This has led to consideration for listing whitebark pine (WBP) as a threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act, which has intensified interest in developing management strategies for maintaining and restoring the species. An important, but poorly studied, aspect of WBP restoration is the spatial variation in adaptive genetic variation and the potential of blister rust resistant strains to maintain viable populations in the future. Here, we present a simulation modeling framework to improve understanding of the long-term genetic consequences of the blister rust pathogen, the evolution of rust resistance, and scenarios of planting rust resistant genotypes of whitebark pine. We combine climate niche modeling and eco-evolutionary landscape genetics modeling to evaluate the effects of different scenarios of planting rust-resistant genotypes and impacts of wind field direction on patterns of gene flow. Planting scenarios showed different levels for local extirpation of WBP and increased population-wide blister rust resistance, suggesting that the spatial arrangement and choice of planting locations can greatly affect survival rates of whitebark pine. This study presents a preliminary, but potentially important, framework for facilitating the conservation of whitebark pine.},

Upon fully sampling both populations, the number of shared objects-species, taxonomical units, or gene variants, depending on the context-can be directly counted. In practice, however, only a fraction of each population's objects are likely to be sampled due to stochastic data collection or sequencing techniques. Although methods exists for quantifying population overlap under subsampled conditions, their bias is well documented and the uncertainty of their estimates cannot be quantified. Here we derive and validate a method to rigorously estimate the population overlap from incomplete samples when the total number of objects, species, or genes in each population is known, a special case of the more general β-diversity problem that is particularly relevant in the ecology and genomic epidemiology of malaria. By solving a Bayesian inference problem, this method takes into account the rates of subsampling and produces unbiased and Bayes-optimal estimates of overlap. In addition, it provides a natural framework for computing the uncertainty of its estimates, and can be used prospectively in study planning by quantifying the tradeoff between sampling effort and uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The var genes of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum present a challenge to population geneticists due to their extreme diversity, which is generated by high rates of recombination. These genes encode a primary antigen protein called PfEMP1, which is expressed on the surface of infected red blood cells and elicits protective immune responses. Var gene sequences are characterized by pronounced mosaicism, precluding the use of traditional phylogenetic tools that require bifurcating tree-like evolutionary relationships. We present a new method that identifies highly variable regions (HVRs), and then maps each HVR to a complex network in which each sequence is a node and two nodes are linked if they share an exact match of significant length. Here, networks of var genes that recombine freely are expected to have a uniformly random structure, but constraints on recombination will produce network communities that we identify using a stochastic block model. We validate this method on synthetic data, showing that it correctly recovers populations of constrained recombination, before applying it to the Duffy Binding Like-α (DBLα) domain of var genes. We find nine HVRs whose network communities map in distinctive ways to known DBLα classifications and clinical phenotypes. We show that the recombinational constraints of some HVRs are correlated, while others are independent. These findings suggest that this micromodular structuring facilitates independent evolutionary trajectories of neighboring mosaic regions, allowing the parasite to retain protein function while generating enormous sequence diversity. Our approach therefore offers a rigorous method for analyzing evolutionary constraints in var genes, and is also flexible enough to be easily applied more generally to any highly recombinant sequences.},

  abstract = {In this paper, results from a pilot study for the South China Sea Monsoon Experiment are reported. Based on analyses of 9 years of pentad and monthly mean data, the climatology of subseasonal features and interannual variability of the Southeast Asian monsoon (SEAM) are documented. The present analysis is focused on the sudden onset of the South China Sea monsoon and its relation to the atmospheric and oceanic processes on the entire Asian monsoon region. It is found that the onset of the SEAM occurs around mid-May, signaling the earliest stage of the entire Asian summer monsoon system. The establishment of monsoon rainfall over the South China Sea is abrupt, being accompanied by substantial changes in the large scale atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature in the adjacent oceans. The onset and fluctuations of SEAM involve the interaction and metamorphosis of the large scale convection over the Indo-China, the South China Sea and the southern Bay of Bengal. Results show that the onset time of the SEAM differs greatly from one year to another. The delayed (advanced) onset of the monsoon may be related to basin-wide warm (cold) events of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. We also present evidence showing that the SEAM fluctuations in May may foreshadow the development of the full-scale Asian summer monsoon during the subsequent months.},

  abstract = {Every year diseases cause lower sugar beet qualities compared to the average. For that reason, high resolution multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data has been used to detect and analyse a fungal sugar beet disease in a study area of Southern Germany. A QuickBird high resolution satellite image was chosen to produce the results for the multispectral part of the study. The very high spatial resolution of 0.7 m in PAN mode and 2.5 m in multispectral mode let the sensor become very interesting for remote sensing analysis. Especially the red (630 to 690 nm) and near infrared portions of the spectra (760 to 900 nm) are important for agricultural applications. For the hyperspectral part, airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data has been provided by an " Airborne Visible/Near Infrared Imaging Spectrometer " (AVIS), which is operated by the Ground Truth Center Oberbayern (gtco). To indicate the difference between healthy and unhealthy plants, image classifications were produced and evaluated with hyperspectral field data. Therefore, the hyperspectral radiometer " FieldSpec HandHeld " (by Analytical Spectral Devices) was used to collect the data in the same study area where the two other sensors took their measurements. With a spatial resolution of 0.6 m, the collected field data could be used to train the supervised classifications. Reflection results can be elaborated with spectral and hyperspectral vegetation indices. To detect the sugar beet disease, the different datasets were analysed by calculating vegetation indices. Finally, the resulting images were classified into several vitality classes. This paper presents the comparison and evaluation of the generated classification results from the two different multi-and hyperspectral sensors and discusses the possibility of detecting sugar beet diseases with innovative remote sensing systems and methods.},

AmpSeq data from infectious microbes can inform disease control in multiple ways, such as by measuring drug resistance marker prevalence, distinguishing imported from local cases, and determining the effectiveness of therapeutics. We describe the design and comparative evaluation of two new AmpSeq assays for Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites: a four-locus panel ("4CAST") composed of highly diverse antigens, and a 129-locus panel ("AMPLseq") composed of drug resistance markers, highly diverse loci for inferring relatedness, and a locus to detect Plasmodium vivax co-infection. We explore the performance of each panel in various public health use cases with in silico simulations as well as empirical experiments. The 4CAST panel appears highly suitable for evaluating the number of distinct parasite strains within samples (complexity of infection), showing strong performance across a wide range of parasitaemia levels without a DNA pre-amplification step. For relatedness inference, the larger AMPLseq panel performs similarly to two existing panels of comparable size, despite differences in the data and approach used for designing each panel. Finally, we describe an R package (paneljudge) that facilitates the design and comparative evaluation of genetic panels for relatedness estimation, and we provide general guidance on the design and implementation of AmpSeq panels for the genomic epidemiology of infectious disease.},

Recent results show that the information used by both model-based clustering methods and principal components analysis can be summarized by a matrix of pairwise similarity measures between individuals. Similarity matrices have been constructed in a number of ways, usually treating markers as independent but differing in the weighting given to polymorphisms of different frequencies. Additionally, methods are now being developed that take linkage into account. We review several such matrices and evaluate their information content. A two-stage approach for population identification is to first construct a similarity matrix and then perform clustering. We review a range of common clustering algorithms and evaluate their performance through a simulation study. The clustering step can be performed either on the matrix or by first using a dimension-reduction technique; we find that the latter approach substantially improves the performance of most algorithms. Based on these results, we describe the population structure signal contained in each similarity matrix and find that accounting for linkage leads to significant improvements for sequence data. We also perform a comparison on real data, where we find that population genetics models outperform generic clustering approaches, particularly with regard to robustness for features such as relatedness between individuals.},

The recent proliferation of DNA sequencing technologies has sparked a rapid increase in the volume of genetic data being applied to phylogenetic studies. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, ubiquitous genetic markers once considered reserved for population genetic studies, are now being applied in phylogenetics research at deep evolutionary timescales. The potential for SNPs to resolve contentious phylogenetic problems while researchers also investigate population demographics is promising, yet serious challenges remain with respect to data collection, assembly, modeling, and analysis. The low cost and ease of collecting SNPs suggest that they will remain an important source of genetic information for inferring phylogenies across time periods ranging from the Anthropocene to the Cretaceous.},

Scales are a joint product of social and biophysical processes. The politics-of-scale metaphor has been helpful in drawing attention to the ways in which scale choices are constrained overtly by politics, and more subtly by choices of technologies, institutional designs, and measurements. In doing so, however, the scale metaphor has been stretched to cover a lot of different spatial relationships. In this paper, we argue that there are benefits to understanding - and actions to distinguish - issues of scale from those of place and position. We illustrate our arguments with examples from the governance of water resources in the Mekong region, where key scientific information is often limited to a few sources. Acknowledging how actors' interests fit along various spatial, temporal, jurisdictional, and other social scales helps make the case for innovative and more inclusive means for bringing multi-level interests to a common forum. Deliberation can provide a check on the extent of shared understanding and key uncertainties.},

Connectivity can arise for many reasons, including shared environments, vector ecology and human movement. This systematic review synthesizes the spatial methods used to model mosquito-borne diseases, their spatial connectivity assumptions and the data used to inform spatial model components. We identified 248 papers eligible for inclusion. Most used statistical models (84.2\%), although mechanistic are increasingly used. We identified 17 spatial models which used one of four methods (spatial covariates, local regression, random effects/fields and movement matrices). Over 80\% of studies assumed that connectivity was distance-based despite this approach ignoring distant connections and potentially oversimplifying the process of transmission. Studies were more likely to assume connectivity was driven by human movement if the disease was transmitted by an Aedes mosquito. Connectivity arising from human movement was more commonly assumed in studies using a mechanistic model, likely influenced by a lack of statistical models able to account for these connections. Although models have been increasing in complexity, it is important to select the most appropriate, parsimonious model available based on the research question, disease transmission process, the spatial scale and availability of data, and the way spatial connectivity is assumed to occur.},

Here we present phylowave,~a scalable approach that summarizes changes in population composition in phylogenetic trees, enabling the automatic detection of lineages based on shared fitness and evolutionary relationships. We use our approach on a broad set of viruses and bacteria (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A subtype H3N2, Bordetella pertussis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), which include both well-studied and understudied threats to human health. We show that phylowave recovers the main known circulating lineages for each pathogen and that it can detect specific amino acid changes linked to fitness changes. Furthermore, phylowave identifies previously undetected lineages with increased fitness, including three co-circulating B.\,pertussis lineages. Inference using phylowave is robust to uneven and limited observations. This widely applicable approach provides an avenue to monitor evolution in real time to support public-health action and explore fundamental drivers of pathogen fitness.},

  abstract = {The Mantel test is widely used in biology, including landscape ecology and genetics, to detect spatial structures in data or control for spatial correlation in the relationship between two data sets, for example community composition and environment. The study demonstrates that this is an incorrect use of that test. The null hypothesis of the Mantel test differs from that of correlation analysis; the statistics computed in the two types of analyses differ. We examined the basic assumptions of the Mantel test in spatial analysis and showed that they are not verified in most studies. We showed the consequences, in terms of power, of the mismatch between these assumptions and the Mantel testing procedure. The Mantel test H0 is the absence of relationship between values in two dissimilarity matrices, not the independence between two random variables or data tables. The Mantel R2 differs from the R2 of correlation, regression and canonical analysis; these two statistics cannot be reduced to one another. Using simulated data, we show that in spatial analysis, the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity of the Mantel test (H1: small values of D1 correspond to small values of D2 and large values of D1 to large values of D2) do not hold in most cases, except when spatial correlation extends over the whole study area. Using extensive simulations of spatially correlated data involving different representations of geographic relationships, we show that the power of the Mantel test is always lower than that of distance-based Moran's eigenvector map (dbMEM) analysis and that the Mantel R2 is always smaller than in dbMEM analysis, and uninterpretable. These simulation results are novel contributions to the Mantel debate. We also show that regression on a geographic distance matrix does not remove the spatial structure from response data and does not produce spatially uncorrelated residuals. Our main conclusion is that Mantel tests should be restricted to questions that, in the domain of application, only concern dissimilarity matrices, and are not derived from questions that can be formulated as the analysis of the vectors and matrices from which one can compute dissimilarity matrices.},

The evolution of resistance is a complex process influenced by transmission dynamics between hosts as well as infection dynamics within these hosts. This study aims to investigate how these two processes combine to impact the evolution of resistance in malaria parasites. We introduce a stochastic modelling framework combining an epidemiological model of Plasmodium transmission and an explicit within-human infection model for two competing strains. Immunity, treatment and resistance costs are included in the within-host model. We show that the spread of resistance is generally less likely in areas of intense transmission, and therefore of increased competition between strains, an effect exacerbated when costs of resistance are higher. We also illustrate how treatment influences the spread of resistance, with a trade-off between slowing resistance and curbing disease incidence. We show that treatment coverage has a stronger impact on disease prevalence, whereas treatment efficacy primarily affects resistance spread, suggesting that coverage should constitute the primary focus of control efforts. Finally, we illustrate the importance of feedbacks between modelling scales. Overall, our results underline the importance of concomitantly modelling the evolution of resistance within and between hosts.},

The combination of best available sources for lakes and wetlands on a global scale (1:1 to 1:3 million resolution), and the application of Geographic Information System (GIS) functionality enabled the generation of a database which focuses in three coordinated levels on (1) large lakes and reservoirs, (2) smaller water bodies, and (3) wetlands. Level 1 comprises the shoreline polygons of the 3067 largest lakes (surface area ≥50 km2) and 654 largest reservoirs (storage capacity ≥0.5 km3) worldwide, and offers extensive attribute data. Level 2 contains the shoreline polygons of approx. 250,000 smaller lakes, reservoirs and rivers (surface area ≥0.1 km2), excluding all water bodies of level 1. Finally, level 3 represents lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and different wetland types in the form of a global raster map at 30-second resolution, including all water bodies of levels 1 and 2. In a validation against documented data, GLWD proved to represent a comprehensive database of global lakes ≥1 km2 and to provide a good representation of the maximum global wetland extent. GLWD-1 and GLWD-2 establish two global polygon maps to which existing lake registers, compilations or remote sensing data can be linked in order to allow for further analyses in a GIS environment. GLWD-3 may serve as an estimate of wetland extents for global hydrology and climatology models, or to identify large-scale wetland distributions and important wetland complexes. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Information on vegetation phenology and land cover for the area of the Mekong Basin are derived for the year 2010, based on optical satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). On account of almost persistent cloud cover in the rainy season, the application of optical remote sensing data presents a challenging exercise and demands special data processing and classification methods. An Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series is produced based on data from both platforms AQUA and TERRA, with dropouts and noise being effectively reduced by applying an adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter. Thereby, different parameterisation is applied dependent on the number of harvest cycles, which are defined by an initial harmonic analysis, based on an EVI time series of 5. years. Information on land cover is derived by a multistep unsupervised classification approach optimised for regions with frequent cloud cover, based on multispectral monthly and seasonal composites, amplitude and phase information from a 11-year EVI time series (2001-2011), and phenological metrics from 2010. Moreover, the environmental heterogenic conditions in the region are addressed by a regionally tuned clustering approach based on physiographic subregions and the use of auxiliary geodata. The results obtained demonstrate that the adapted approach performs satisfactory in terms of accuracy under given conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The distribution patterns of malaria incidence at a village level in Thailand were demonstrated with the use of a geographical information system (GIS), and provided the study of the malaria situation at a household level. Mosaic imageries from aerial photographs were used to create maps that contained X and Y coordinates. These digitized base maps were kept as computerized files. Standard Distance Ellipse (SDE) was used to measure the prevalence of dispersion around the mean center of malaria cases and points. Households in the SDE were at greater risk of malaria infection than those located outside the SDE. The spatial pattern of malaria incidence was investigated using spatial autocorrelation using Geary's ratio and Moran's index. Five of seven villages had a clustered spatial distribution of malaria incidence, the vector point of which had a 2–3km range from the patient's houses. Only one village had a significant clustered spatial distribution of malaria incidence (p{$<$}0.05). Control efforts should be focused on high-risk areas, especially those households with the heaviest caseloads. This approach would probably be more cost effective than the conventional malaria control methods. This SDE analytical technique would be a novel and useful epidemiological control method for use by public health administrators. The ellipsoidal areas required malaria control intervention.},

  abstract = {As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.},

  abstract = {Zoonotic disease transmission systems involve sets of species interacting with each other and their environment. This complexity impedes development of disease monitoring and control programs that require reliable identification of spatial and biotic variables and mechanisms facilitating disease emergence. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a framework that simultaneously examines all species involved in disease emergence by integrating concepts and methods from population genetics, landscape ecology, and spatial statistics. Multi-taxa integrated landscape genetics (MTILG) can reveal how interspecific interactions and landscape variables influence disease emergence patterns. We test the potential of our MTILG-based framework by modelling the emergence of a disease system across multiple species dispersal, interspecific interaction, and landscape scenarios. Our simulations showed that both interspecific-dependent dispersal patterns and landscape characteristics significantly influenced disease spread. Using our framework, we were able to detect statistically similar inter-population genetic differences and highly correlated spatial genetic patterns that imply species-dependent dispersal. Additionally, species that were assigned coupled-dispersal patterns were affected to the same degree by similar landscape variables. This study underlines the importance of an integrated approach to investigating emergence of disease systems. MTILG is a robust approach for such studies and can identify potential avenues for targeted disease management strategies. (English)},

New amplicon sequencing and data analysis protocols are needed for genotyping in epidemiological studies and drug efficacy trials of P. falciparum. METHODS: Targeted sequencing of molecular marker csp and novel marker cpmp was conducted in duplicate on mixtures of parasite culture strains and 37 field samples. A protocol allowing to multiplex up to 384 samples in a single sequencing run was applied. Software "HaplotypR" was developed for data analysis. RESULTS: Cpmp was highly diverse (He~=~0.96) in contrast to csp (He~=~0.57). Minority clones were robustly detected if their frequency was {$>$}1\%. False haplotype calls owing to sequencing errors were observed below that threshold. CONCLUSIONS: To reliably detect haplotypes at very low frequencies, experiments are best performed in duplicate and should aim for coverage of {$>$}10'000 reads/amplicon. When compared to length polymorphic marker msp2, highly multiplexed amplicon sequencing displayed greater sensitivity in detecting minority clones.},

  abstract = {This report represents a state-of-the-art synthesis of current knowledge of the ecology and hydrology of ephemeral (dry washes) and intermittent streams in the American Southwest, and may have important bearing on establishing nexus to traditional navigable waters (TNW) and defining connectivity relative to the Clean Water Act. Ephemeral and intermittent streams make up approximately 59\% of all streams in the United States (excluding Alaska), and over 81\% in the arid and semi-arid Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Colorado and California) according to the U.S. Geological Survey National Hydrography Dataset. They are often the headwaters or major tributaries of perennial streams in the Southwest. This comprehensive review of the present scientific understanding of the ecology and hydrology of ephemeral and intermittent streams will help place them in a watershed context, thereby highlighting their importance in maintaining water quality, overall watershed function or health, and provisioning of the essential human and biological requirements of clean water. Ephemeral and intermittent streams provide the same ecological and hydrological functions as perennial streams by moving water, nutrients, and sediment throughout the watershed. When functioning properly, these streams provide landscape hydrologic connections; stream energy dissipation during high-water flows to reduce erosion and improve water quality; surface and subsurface water storage and exchange; ground-water recharge and discharge; sediment transport, storage, and deposition to aid in floodplain maintenance and development; nutrient storage and cycling; wildlife habitat and migration corridors; support for vegetation communities to help stabilize stream banks and provide wildlife services; and water supply and water-quality filtering. They provide a wide array of ecological functions including forage, cover, nesting, and movement corridors for wildlife. Because of the relatively higher moisture content in arid and semi-arid region streams, vegetation and wildlife abundance and diversity in and near them is proportionally higher than in the surrounding uplands. In the rapidly developing southwest, land management decisions must employ a watershed-scale approach that addresses overall watershed function and water quality. Ephemeral and intermittent stream systems comprise a large portion of southwestern watersheds, and contribute to the hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological health of a watershed. Given their importance and vast extent, it is concluded that an individual ephemeral or intermittent stream segment should not be examined in isolation. Consideration of the cumulative impacts from anthropogenic uses on these streams is critical in watershed-based assessments and land management decisions to maintain overall watershed health and water quality.},

The indexes were designed and selected reasonably based on spectral features and geometric shapes of water on the scale of 30 m resolution, the water information was extracted in an elaborate way by combining a simple and easy operation through pixel-based classification method with a comprehensive utilization of various rules and knowledge through the object-oriented classification method, and finally the classification results were further optimized and improved by the human-computer interaction, thus realizing high-resolution remote sensing mapping of global water. The completed global land water data results, including Global Land 30-water 2000 and Global Land 30-water 2010, are the classification results featuring the highest resolution on a global scale, and the overall accuracy of self-assessment is 96\%.

  abstract = {Background Understanding the genetic structure of natural populations provides insight into the demographic and adaptive processes that have affected those populations. Such information, particularly when integrated with geospatial data, can have translational applications for a variety of fields, including public health. Estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS) is an approach that allows visualization of the spatial patterns in genomic data to understand population structure and migration. In this study, we developed a workflow to optimize the resolution of spatial grids used to generate EEMS migration maps and applied this optimized workflow to estimate migration of Plasmodium falciparum in Cambodia and bordering regions of Thailand and Vietnam. Methods The optimal density of EEMS grids was determined based on a new workflow created using density clustering to define genomic clusters and the spatial distance between genomic clusters. Topological skeletons were used to capture the spatial distribution for each genomic cluster and to determine the EEMS grid density; i.e., both genomic and spatial clustering were used to guide the optimization of EEMS grids. Model accuracy for migration estimates using the optimized workflow was tested and compared to grid resolutions selected without the optimized workflow. As a test case, the optimized workflow was applied to genomic data generated from P. falciparum sampled in Cambodia and bordering regions, and migration maps were compared to estimates of malaria endemicity, as well as geographic properties of the study area, as a means of validating observed migration patterns. Results Optimized grids displayed both high model accuracy and reduced computing time compared to grid densities selected in an unguided manner. In addition, EEMS migration maps generated for P. falciparum using the optimized grid corresponded to estimates of malaria endemicity and geographic properties of the study region that might be expected to impact malaria parasite migration, supporting the validity of the observed migration patterns. Conclusions Optimized grids reduce spatial uncertainty in the EEMS contours that can result from user-defined parameters, such as the resolution of the spatial grid used in the model. This workflow will be useful to a broad range of EEMS users as it can be applied to analyses involving other organisms of interest and geographic areas.},

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

Using these data, we showed that different patterns of these parameters in both directions may be clearly observed among the three sites.

Although widespread, this procedure has the potential to alter downstream population genetic inferences and has received relatively little rigorous analysis. Here we use simulations and an empirical single nucleotide polymorphism data set to demonstrate the impacts of MAF thresholds on inference of population structure-often the first step in analysis of population genomic data. We find that model-based inference of population structure is confounded when singletons are included in the alignment, and that both model-based and multivariate analyses infer less distinct clusters when more stringent MAF cutoffs are applied. We propose that this behaviour is caused by the combination of a drop in the total size of the data matrix and by correlations between allele frequencies and mutational age. We recommend a set of best practices for applying MAF filters in studies seeking to describe population structure with genomic data.},

  abstract = {A quantitative method is developed for deriving water fraction from coarse- to medium-resolution satellite data with visible to short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels based on the linear mixture theory. The method uses a SWIR channel (1.64 \&\#x03BC;m) by assuming that the water-surface-leaving radiance in this channel is insignificant and is thus less affected by water types and water depth than near-infrared (NIR) channels for inland water bodies. For a mixed water pixel, a dynamic nearest neighbor searching (DNNS) method is used to find the nearby land pixels to determine the average land reflectance. The nearby pure water pixels with a similar water type to the subpixel water portion of the mixed water pixel are found dynamically to derive the average water reflectance. The average reflectance in the SWIR channel from both pure land pixels and water pixels is used to calculate the water fraction from a linear mixture model. The developed method is applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and shows promising results. High-resolution satellite data from the Thematic Mapper (TM) are used to evaluate the water fraction derived from MODIS. During pixel-to-pixel water fraction evaluation, TM data are spatially aggregated to MODIS resolution. When evaluated against the high-resolution TM observations, water fractions derived from MODIS using the DNNS method with the SWIR channel show a bias of -0.021 with a standard deviation of 0.0338. Comparing lake areas between TM and MODIS data also shows consistent results with the pixel-to-pixel water fraction comparison. The DNNS method is also compared to the traditional histogram method both with SWIR channel and NIR channel. The results show that the DNNS method is more accurate than the histogram method and that the SWIR channel is better than the NIR channel to derive highly accurate water fraction from coarse- to medium-resolution satellite data.},

  abstract = {Terrain shadow is a big challenge to land products such as flood extent and snow cover from moderate-resolution optical satellite data. Because terrain shadows share similar spectral features with floodwaters, they can be easily detected as floodwaters by flood detection algorithms based on spectral features in visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared channels, which decreases the accuracy of flood detection substantially. However, because terrain shadows appear in mountainous areas with large surface roughness while floodwaters accumulate in low-lying areas with small surface roughness, analysis on surface roughness between terrain shadows and floodwaters can be very effective to distinguish one from the other. Root-mean-square height, internal height difference, and external height difference are used as principal quantitative surface roughness parameters in this study and calculated upon water objects that are clustered from a group of adjacent water pixels. This object-based method is applied in terrain shadow removal from SNPP/VIIRS (Suomi National Polar Orbit Partnership/Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite) near-real-time flood maps and shows promising results according to the tests with 10,000+ VIIRS granules across global areas. Quantitative evaluation in the northwest of the USA also indicates that more than 99\% terrain shadow pixels could be removed from VIIRS flood maps by this method, which significantly improves the accuracy of near-real-time flood detection from SNPP/VIIRS imagery.},

We assess the performance and accuracy of pgHMA by comparing the results obtained against those obtained using standard methods of analyses applied to sequencing data. The resulting comparisons demonstrate that: (a) there is a significant linear relationship (R2 ~=~.992) between heteroduplex mobility and genetic distance, (b) phylogenetic trees obtained by HMA and nucleotide sequences present nearly identical topologies, (c) clades with high pgHMA parametric bootstrap support also have high bootstrap support on nucleotide phylogenies, (d) skyline plots estimated from the UPGMA trees of HMA and Bayesian trees of nucleotide data reveal similar trends, especially for the median trend estimate of effective population size, and (e) optimized mismatch distributions of HMA are closely fitted to the mismatch distributions of nucleotide sequences. In summary, pgHMA is an easily-applied method for approximating phylogenetic diversity and population trends.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Accurate estimates of species relationships are integral to our understanding of evolution, yet many relationships remain controversial despite whole-genome sequence data. These controversies are due in part to complex patterns of phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic signal coming from regions of the genome experiencing distinct evolutionary forces, which can be difficult to disentangle. Here we profile the amounts and proportions of phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic signal derived from loci spread across mammalian genomes. We identified orthologous sequences from primates, rodents, and pecora, annotated sites as one or more of nine locus types (e.g. coding, intronic, intergenic), and profiled the phylogenetic information contained within locus types across evolutionary timescales associated with each clade. In all cases, non-coding loci provided more overall signal and a higher proportion of phylogenetic signal compared to coding loci. This suggests potential benefits of shifting away from primarily targeting genes or coding regions for phylogenetic studies, particularly in this era of accessible whole genome sequence data. In contrast to long-held assumptions about the phylogenetic utility of more variable genomic regions, most locus types provided relatively consistent phylogenetic information across timescales, although we find evidence that coding and intronic regions may, respectively and to a limited degree, inform disproportionately about older and younger splits. As part of this work we also validate the SISRS pipeline as an annotation-free ortholog discovery pipeline capable of identifying millions of phylogenetically informative sites directly from raw sequencing reads.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Malaria transmission can be affected by multiple or even hidden factors, making it difficult to timely and accurately predict the impact of elimination and eradication programs that have been undertaken and the potential resurgence and spread that may continue to emerge. One approach at the moment is to develop and deploy surveillance systems in an attempt to identify them as timely as possible and thus to enable policy makers to modify and implement strategies for further preventing the transmission. Most of the surveillance data will be of temporal and spatial nature. From an interdisciplinary point of view, it would be interesting to ask the following important as well as challenging question: Based on the available surveillance data in temporal and spatial forms, how can we build a more effective surveillance mechanism for monitoring and early detecting the relative prevalence and transmission patterns of malaria? What we can note from the existing clustering-based surveillance software systems is that they do not infer the underlying transmission networks of malaria. However, such networks can be quite informative and insightful as they characterize how malaria transmits from one place to another. They can also in turn allow public health policy makers and researchers to uncover the hidden and interacting factors such as environment, genetics and ecology and to discover/predict malaria transmission patterns/trends. The network perspective further extends the present approaches to modelling malaria transmission based on a set of chosen factors. In this article, we survey the related work on transmission network inference, discuss how such an approach can be utilized in developing an effective computational means for inferring malaria transmission networks based on partial surveillance data, and what methodological steps and issues may be involved in its formulation and validation.},

A multi-agent mobility simulation model was built to simulate the movements of villagers between home and their workplaces in two townships in Myanmar. METHODS: An agent-based model (ABM) was built to simulate daily travel to and from work based on responses to a travel survey. Key elements for the ABM were landcover, travel time, travel mode, occupation, malaria prevalence, and a detailed road network. Most visited network segments (MVS) for different occupations and for malaria-positive cases were extracted and compared. Data from a separate survey was used to validate the simulation. RESULTS: Mobility characteristics for different occupation groups showed that while certain patterns were shared among some groups, there were also patterns that were unique to an occupation group. Forest workers were estimated to be the most mobile occupation group, and also had the highest potential malaria exposure associated with their daily travel in Ann Township. In Singu Township, forest workers were not the most mobile group; however, they were estimated to visit regions that had higher prevalence of malaria infection over other occupation groups. CONCLUSIONS: Using an ABM to simulate daily travel generated mobility patterns for different occupation groups. These spatial patterns varied by occupation. Our simulation identified occupations at a higher risk of being exposed to malaria and where these exposures were more likely to occur.},

PvDBP copy number has been recently shown to vary between P. vivax isolates in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the extent of PvDBP copy number variation, the type of PvDBP multiplications, as well as its significance across broad samples are still unclear. We determined the prevalence and type of PvDBP duplications, as well as PvDBP copy number variation among 178 Ethiopian P. vivax isolates using a PCR-based diagnostic method, a novel quantitative real-time PCR assay and whole genome sequencing. For the 145 symptomatic samples, PvDBP duplications were detected in 95 isolates, of which 81 had the Cambodian and 14 Malagasy-type PvDBP duplications. PvDBP varied from 1 to {$>$}4 copies. Isolates with multiple PvDBP copies were found to be higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic infections. For the 33 asymptomatic samples, PvDBP was detected with two copies in two of the isolates, and both were the Cambodian-type PvDBP duplication. PvDBP copy number in Duffy-negative heterozygotes was not significantly different from that in Duffy-positives, providing no support for the hypothesis that increased copy number is a specific association with Duffy-negativity, although the number of Duffy-negatives was small and further sampling is required to test this association thoroughly.},

Methods Microsatellite markers were used to examine source-sink dynamics for Plasmodium vivax between IDP settlements and surrounding villages in the border region. Genotypic structure and diversity were compared across the 3 years following the establishment of IDP settlements, to infer demographic history. We investigated whether human migration and landscape heterogeneity contributed to P. vivax transmission. Results P. vivax from IDP settlements and local communities consistently exhibited high genetic diversity within populations but low polyclonality within individuals. No apparent genetic structure was observed among populations and years. P. vivax genotypes in China were similar to those in Myanmar, and parasite introduction was unidirectional. Landscape factors, including distance, elevation, and land cover, do not appear to impede parasite gene flow. Conclusions The admixture of P. vivax genotypes suggested that parasite gene flow via human movement contributes to the spread of malaria both locally in Myanmar and across the international border. Our genetic findings highlight the presence of large P. vivax gene reservoirs that can sustain transmission. Thus, it is important to reinforce and improve existing control efforts along border areas.},

They are reservoirs of malaria parasite that can contribute to disease transmission. Therefore, identification and control of asymptomatic infections are important to make malaria elimination feasible. In this study, we investigated the extent and distribution of asymptomatic malaria in Western Kenya and examined how varying parasitemia affects performance of diagnostic methods including microscopy, conventional PCR, and quantitative PCR. In addition, we compared parasite prevalence rates and parasitemia levels with respect to topography and age in order to explore factors that influence malaria infection. Over 11,000 asymptomatic blood samples from children and adolescents up to 18 years old representing broad areas of Western Kenya were included. Quantitative PCR revealed the highest parasite positive rate among all methods and malaria prevalence in western Kenya varied widely from less than 1\% to over 50\%. A significantly lower parasitemia was detected in highland than in lowland samples and this contrast was also observed primarily among submicroscopic samples. Although we found no correlation between parasitemia level and age, individuals of younger age group (aged {$<$}14) showed significantly higher parasite prevalence. In the lowlands, individuals of aged 5-14 showed significantly higher prevalence than those under age 5. Our findings highlight the need for a more sensitive and time-efficient assay for asymptomatic malaria detection particularly in areas of low-transmission.

Mean multiplicity of infection (MOI) and the proportion of polyclonal infections are often reported as surrogate marker of transmission intensity, yet the relationship with traditional measures such as parasite prevalence is not well understood. We have searched Pubmed for articles on P. falciparum and P. vivax multiplicity, and compared the proportion of polyclonal infections and mean MOI to population prevalence. The impact of the genotyping method, number of genotyping markers, method for diagnosis (microscopy/RDT vs. PCR), presence of clinical symptoms, age, geographic region, and year of sample collection on multiplicity indices were assessed. For P. falciparum, 153 studies met inclusion criteria, yielding 275 individual data points and 33,526 genotyped individuals. The proportion of polyclonal infections ranged from 0-96\%, and mean MOI from 1-6.1. For P. vivax, 54 studies met inclusion criteria, yielding 115 data points and 13,325 genotyped individuals. The proportion of polyclonal infections ranged from 0-100\%, and mean MOI from 1-3.8. For both species, the proportion of polyclonal infections ranged from very low to close to 100\% at low prevalence, while at high prevalence it was always high. Each percentage point increase in prevalence resulted in a 0.34\% increase in the proportion of polyclonal P. falciparum infections (P{$<$}0.001), and a 0.78\% increase in the proportion of polyclonal P. vivax infections (P{$<$}0.001). In multivariable analysis, higher prevalence, typing multiple markers, diagnosis of infections by PCR, and sampling in Africa were found to result in a higher proportion of P. falciparum polyclonal infections. For P. vivax, prevalence, year of study, typing multiple markers, and geographic region were significant predictors. In conclusion, polyclonal infections are frequently present in all settings, but the association between multiplicity and prevalence is weak.},

  abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be useful in revealing population structure with continental-and regional-scale samples. In epidemiological study, a careful selection of SNPs to track disease spread in local communities would provide an important addition to traditional disease surveillance. This study used SNPs and microsatellites to examine population structure of Plasmodium falciparum at fine- scale in malaria-endemic areas of Western Kenya. A set of high performance (HP) SNPs were selected from a large SNP panel based on BELS ranking, FST values and minor allele frequency criteria. The discriminative power and assignment accuracy of different SNP panels including nonsynonymous SNPs, silent SNPs, previously published barcode SNPs, and the HP SNPs were evaluated together with microsatellites. Among all SNP panels, HP SNPs showed the highest level of differentiation and self-assignment accuracy on average among sites. Clear distinction was observed between the northern and southern P. falciparum samples, whereas samples from the south were least diverged from one another. These results were comparable to those by microsatellites. Nonsynonymous, silent, and barcode SNPs all showed similar levels of genetic variability to one another and weaker structure than the HP SNPs. We described here the procedure of selecting a set of HP SNPs from a large panel of SNPs that resolve population structure of P. falciparum between the northern and southern regions of Western Kenya. Future work is needed to determine if this procedure can result in SNPs panels capable of tracing Plasmodium spread at finer geographical scales.},

  abstract = {Ethiopia is one of the few African countries where Plasmodium vivax is co-endemic with P. falciparum. Malaria transmission is seasonal and transmission intensity varies mainly by landscape and climate. Although the recent emergence of drug resistant parasites presents a major issue to malaria control in Ethiopia, little is known about the transmission pathways of parasite species and prevalence of resistant markers. This study used microsatellites to determine population diversity and gene flow patterns of P. falciparum (N = 226) and P. vivax (N = 205), as well as prevalence of drug resistant markers to infer the impact of gene flow and existing malaria treatment regimes. Plasmodium falciparum indicated a higher rate of polyclonal infections than P. vivax. Both species revealed moderate genetic diversity and similar population structure. Populations in the northern highlands were closely related to the eastern Rift Valley, but slightly distinct from the southern basin area. Gene flow via human migrations between the northern and eastern populations were frequent and mostly bidirectional. Landscape genetic analyses indicated that environmental heterogeneity and geographical distance did not constrain parasite gene flow. This may partly explain similar patterns of resistant marker prevalence. In P. falciparum, a high prevalence of mutant alleles was detected in codons related to chloroquine (pfcrt and pfmdr1) and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (pfdhps and pfdhfr) resistance. Over 60\% of the samples showed pfmdr1 duplications. Nevertheless, no mutation was detected in pfK13 that relates to artemisinin resistance. In P. vivax, while sequences of pvcrt-o were highly conserved and less than 5\% of the samples showed pvmdr duplications, over 50\% of the samples had pvmdr1 976F mutation. It remains to be tested if this mutation relates to chloroquine resistance. Monitoring the extent of malaria spread and markers of drug resistance is imperative to inform policy for evidence-based antimalarial choice and interventions. To effectively reduce malaria burden in Ethiopia, control efforts should focus on seasonal migrant populations.},

In this perspective, the potential barriers to achieving global malaria elimination are discussed with respect to the related diversities in host, parasite, and vector populations. We argue that control strategies need to be reorientated from a sequential attack on each species, dominated by Plasmodium falciparum to one that targets all species in parallel.

  abstract = {Crop mapping is one major component of agricultural resource monitoring using remote sensing. Yield or water demand modeling requires that both, the total surface that is cultivated and the accurate distribution of crops, respectively is known. Map quality is crucial and influences the model outputs. Although the use of multi-spectral time series data in crop mapping has been acknowledged, the potentially high dimensionality of the input data remains an issue. In this study Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for crop classification in irrigated landscapes at the object-level. Input to the classifications is 71 multi-seasonal spectral and geostatistical features computed from RapidEye time series. The random forest (RF) feature importance score was used to select a subset of features that achieved optimal accuracies. The relationship between the hard result accuracy and the soft output from the SVM is investigated by employing two measures of uncertainty, the maximum a posteriori probability and the alpha quadratic entropy. Specifically the effect of feature selection on map uncertainty is investigated by looking at the soft outputs of the SVM, in addition to classical accuracy metrics. Overall the SVMs applied to the reduced feature subspaces that were composed of the most informative multi-seasonal features led to a clear increase in classification accuracy up to 4.3\%, and to a significant decline in thematic uncertainty. SVM was shown to be affected by feature space size and could benefit from RF-based feature selection. Uncertainty measures from SVM are an informative source of information on the spatial distribution of error in the crop maps. © 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

  abstract = {Mixed-effects models are being used ever more frequently in the analysis of experimental data. However, in the lme4 package in R the standards for evaluating significance of fixed effects in these models (i.e., obtaining p-values) are somewhat vague. There are good reasons for this, but as researchers who are using these models are required in many cases to report p-values, some method for evaluating the significance of the model output is needed. This paper reports the results of simulations showing that the two most common methods for evaluating significance, using likelihood ratio tests and applying the z distribution to the Wald t values from the model output (t-as-z), are somewhat anti-conservative, especially for smaller sample sizes. Other methods for evaluating significance, including parametric bootstrapping and the Kenward-Roger and Satterthwaite approximations for degrees of freedom, were also evaluated. The results of these simulations suggest that Type 1 error rates are closest to .05 when models are fitted using REML and p-values are derived using the Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite approximations, as these approximations both produced acceptable Type 1 error rates even for smaller samples.},

The application of next generation sequencing (NGS) and CRISPR-Cas tools is now poised to support endemic countries in the detection, monitoring and control of endemic diseases and future epidemics, as well as with emerging and re-emerging pathogens. Most low and middle income countries (LMICs) with the highest burden of infectious diseases still largely lack the capacity to generate and perform bioinformatic analysis of genomic data. These countries have also not deployed tools based on CRISPR-Cas technologies. For LMICs including Tanzania, it is critical to focus not only on the process of generation and analysis of data generated using such tools, but also on the utilization of the findings for policy and decision making. Here we discuss the promise and challenges of NGS and CRISPR-Cas in the context of malaria as Africa moves towards malaria elimination. These innovative tools are urgently needed to strengthen the current diagnostic and surveillance systems. We discuss ongoing efforts to deploy these tools for malaria detection and molecular surveillance highlighting potential opportunities presented by these innovative technologies as well as challenges in adopting them. Their deployment will also offer an opportunity to broadly build in-country capacity in pathogen genomics and bioinformatics, and to effectively engage with multiple stakeholders as well as policy makers, overcoming current workforce and infrastructure challenges. Overall, these ongoing initiatives will build the malaria molecular surveillance capacity of African researchers and their institutions, and allow them to generate genomics data and perform bioinformatics analysis in-country in order to provide critical information that will be used for real-time policy and decision-making to support malaria elimination on the continent.},

  abstract = {Deforestation and land use change are among the most pressing anthropogenic environmental impacts. In Brazil, a resurgence of malaria in recent decades paralleled rapid deforestation and settlement in the Amazon basin, yet evidence of a deforestation-driven increase in malaria remains equivocal. We hypothesize an underlying cause of this ambiguity is that deforestation and malaria influence each other in bidirectional causal relationships-deforestation increases malaria through ecological mechanisms and malaria reduces deforestation through socioeconomic mechanisms-and that the strength of these relationships depends on the stage of land use transformation. We test these hypotheses with a large geospatial dataset encompassing 795 municipalities across 13 y (2003 to 2015) and show deforestation has a strong positive effect on malaria incidence. Our results suggest a 10\% increase in deforestation leads to a 3.3\% increase in malaria incidence (∼9,980 additional cases associated with 1,567 additional km2 lost in 2008, the study midpoint, Amazon-wide). The effect is larger in the interior and absent in outer Amazonian states where little forest remains. However, this strong effect is only detectable after controlling for a feedback of malaria burden on forest loss, whereby increased malaria burden significantly reduces forest clearing, possibly mediated by human behavior or economic development. We estimate a 1\% increase in malaria incidence results in a 1.4\% decrease in forest area cleared (∼219 fewer km2 cleared associated with 3,024 additional cases in 2008). This bidirectional socioecological feedback between deforestation and malaria, which attenuates as land use intensifies, illustrates the intimate ties between environmental change and human health.},

These are the first complete mitogenomes of these four genera and Scaphiopodidae. We assembled mitogenomes from short genomic sequence reads using a baiting and iterative mapping strategy followed by a new ad hoc mapping strategy developed to test for assembly circularization. To assess the quality of the inferred circularization, we used Bowtie2 alignment scores and a new per-position sequence coverage value (which we named “connectivity”). Permutation tests with 400 iterations per specimen and 1\% or 5\% chance of mutation at the ends of the putative circular sequences showed that the proposed method is highly sensitive, with a single nucleotide insertion or deletion being sufficient for circularity to be rejected. False positives comprised only 2\% of all observations and possessed significantly lower alignment scores. The size, gene content, and gene arrangement of each mitogenome differed among the species but matched the expectations for their clades. We argue that basic studies on circular sequences can benefit from the results and bioinformatics procedures introduced here, especially when closely related references are lacking.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spatial and temporal malaria risk maps are essential tools to monitor the impact of control, evaluate priority areas to reorient intervention approaches and investments in malaria endemic countries. Here, the analysis of 36~years data on Plasmodium falciparum prevalence is used to understand the past and chart a future for malaria control in Kenya by confidently highlighting areas within important policy relevant thresholds to allow either the revision of malaria strategies to those that support pre-elimination or those that require additional control efforts. METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence (PfPR) surveys undertaken in Kenya between 1980 and 2015 were assembled. A spatio-temporal geostatistical model was fitted to predict annual malaria risk for children aged 2-10~years (PfPR2-10) at 1\,×\,1~km spatial resolution from 1990 to 2015. Changing PfPR2-10 was compared against plausible explanatory variables. The fitted model was used to categorize areas with varying degrees of prediction probability for two important policy thresholds PfPR2-10\,{$<$}\,1\% (non-exceedance probability) or ≥\,30\% (exceedance probability). RESULTS: 5020 surveys at 3701 communities were assembled. Nationally, there was an 88\% reduction in the mean modelled PfPR2-10 from 21.2\% (ICR: 13.8-32.1\%) in 1990 to 2.6\% (ICR: 1.8-3.9\%) in 2015. The most significant decline began in 2003. Declining prevalence was not equal across the country and did not directly coincide with scaled vector control coverage or changing therapeutics. Over the period 2013-2015, of Kenya's 47 counties, 23 had an average PfPR2-10 of {$<$}\,1\%; four counties remained ≥\,30\%. Using a metric of 80\% probability, 8.5\% of Kenya's 2015 population live in areas with PfPR2-10 ≥\,30\%; while 61\% live in areas where PfPR2-10 is {$<$}\,1\%. CONCLUSIONS: Kenya has made substantial progress in reducing the prevalence of malaria over the last 26~years. Areas today confidently and consistently with {$<$}\,1\% prevalence require a revised approach to control and a possible consideration of strategies that support pre-elimination. Conversely, there remains several intractable areas where current levels and approaches to control might be inadequate. The modelling approaches presented here allow the Ministry of Health opportunities to consider data-driven model certainty in defining their future spatial targeting of resources.},

  abstract = {Background Food access is a global issue, and for this reason, a wealth of studies are dedicated to understanding the location of food deserts and the benefits of urban gardens. However, few studies have linked these two strands of research together to analyze whether urban gardening activity may be a step forward in addressing issues of access for food desert residents. Methods The Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area is used as a case to demonstrate the utility of spatial optimization models for siting urban gardens near food deserts and on vacant land. The locations of urban gardens are derived from a list obtained from the Maricopa County Cooperative Extension office at the University of Arizona which were geo located and aggregated to Census tracts. Census tracts were then assigned to one of three categories: tracts that contain a garden, tracts that are immediately adjacent to a tract with a garden, and all other non-garden/non-adjacent census tracts. Analysis of variance is first used to ascertain whether there are statistical differences in the demographic, socio-economic, and land use profiles of these three categories of tracts. A maximal covering spatial optimization model is then used to identify potential locations for future gardening activities. A constraint of these models is that gardens be located on vacant land, which is a growing problem in rapidly urbanizing environments worldwide. Results The spatial analysis of garden locations reveals that they are centrally located in tracts with good food access. Thus, the current distribution of gardens does not provide an alternative food source to occupants of food deserts. The maximal covering spatial optimization model reveals that gardens could be sited in alternative locations to better serve food desert residents. In fact, 53 gardens may be located to cover 96.4\% of all food deserts. This is an improvement over the current distribution of gardens where 68 active garden sites provide coverage to a scant 8.4\% of food desert residents. Conclusion People in rapidly urbanizing environments around the globe suffer from poor food access. Rapid rates of urbanization also present an unused vacant land problem in cities around the globe. This paper highlights how spatial optimization models can be used to improve healthy food access for food desert residents, which is a critical first step in ameliorating the health problems associated with lack of healthy food access including heart disease and obesity.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide searches for loci involved in human resistance to malaria are currently being conducted on a large scale in Africa using case-control studies. Here, we explore the utility of an alternative approach-"environmental correlation analysis, ECA," which tests for clines in allele frequencies across a gradient of an environmental selection pressure-to identify genes that have historically protected against death from malaria. We collected genotype data from 12,425 newborns on 57 candidate malaria resistance loci and 9,756 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected at random from across the genome, and examined their allele frequencies for geographic correlations with long-term malaria prevalence data based on 84,042 individuals living under different historical selection pressures from malaria in coastal Kenya. None of the 57 candidate SNPs showed significant (P {$<$} 0.05) correlations in allele frequency with local malaria transmission intensity after adjusting for population structure and multiple testing. In contrast, two of the random SNPs that had highly significant correlations (P {$<$} 0.01) were in genes previously linked to malaria resistance, namely, CDH13, encoding cadherin 13, and HS3ST3B1, encoding heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1. Both proteins play a role in glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell adhesion which has been widely implicated in cerebral malaria, the most life-threatening form of this disease. Other top genes, including CTNND2 which encodes δ-catenin, a molecular partner to cadherin, were significantly enriched in cadherin-mediated pathways affecting inflammation of the brain vascular endothelium. These results demonstrate the utility of ECA in the discovery of novel genes and pathways affecting infectious disease.},

  abstract = {Genes can be transcribed from within chromosome territories; however, the major histocompatibilty complex locus has been reported extending away from chromosome territories, and the incidence of this correlates with transcription from the region. A similar result has been seen for the epidermal differentiation complex region of chromosome 1. These data suggested that chromatin decondensation away from the surface of chromosome territories may result from, and/or may facilitate, transcription of densely packed genes subject to coordinate regulation., To investigate whether localization outside of the visible confines of chromosome territories can also occur for regions that are not coordinately regulated, we have examined the spatial organization of human 11p15.5 and the syntenic region on mouse chromosome 7. This region is gene rich but its genes are not coordinately expressed, rather overall high levels of transcription occur in several cell types. We found that chromatin from 11p15.5 frequently extends away from the chromosome 11 territory. Localization outside of territories was also detected for other regions of high gene density and high levels of transcription. This is shown to be partly dependent on ongoing transcription. We suggest that local gene density and transcription, rather than the activity of individual genes, influences the organization of chromosomes in the nucleus.},

In a large global survey, we find that kelch13 mutations which cause resistance in Southeast Asia are present at low frequency in Africa. We show that African kelch13 mutations have originated locally, and that kelch13 shows a normal variation pattern relative to other genes in Africa, whereas in Southeast Asia there is a great excess of non-synonymous mutations, many of which cause radical amino-acid changes. Thus, kelch13 is not currently undergoing strong selection in Africa, despite a deep reservoir of variations that could potentially allow resistance to emerge rapidly. The practical implications are that public health surveillance for artemisinin resistance should not rely on kelch13 data alone, and interventions to prevent resistance must account for local evolutionary conditions, shown by genomic epidemiology to differ greatly between geographical regions.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of how malaria infections spread locally is important both for the design of targeted interventions aiming to interrupt malaria transmission and the design of trials to assess the interventions. A previous analysis of 1602 genotyped Plasmodium falciparum parasites in Kilifi, Kenya collected over 12 years found an interaction between time and geographic distance: the mean number of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences was lower for pairs of infections which were both a shorter time interval and shorter geographic distance apart. We determine whether the empiric pattern could be reproduced by a simple model, and what mean geographic distances between parent and offspring infections and hypotheses about genotype-specific immunity or a limit on the number of infections would be consistent with the data. We developed an individual-based stochastic simulation model of households, people and infections. We parameterized the model for the total number of infections, and population and household density observed in Kilifi. The acquisition of new infections, mutation, recombination, geographic location and clearance were included. We fit the model to the observed numbers of SNP differences between pairs of parasite genotypes. The patterns observed in the empiric data could be reproduced. Although we cannot rule out genotype-specific immunity or a limit on the number of infections per individual, they are not necessary to account for the observed patterns. The mean geographic distance between parent and offspring malaria infections for the base model was 0.5\,km (95\% CI 0.3-1.5), for a distribution with 68\% of distances shorter than the mean. Very short mean distances did not fit well, but mixtures of distributions were also consistent with the data. For a pathogen which undergoes meiosis in a setting with moderate transmission and a low coverage of infections, analytic methods are limited but an individual-based model can be used with genotyping data to estimate parameter values and investigate hypotheses about underlying processes.},

One way of identifying loci that are possibly under selection is to see which ones are associated with environmental gradient or heterogeneity. Since it is difficult to measure all environmental variables, one may take advantage of the spatial nature of environmental filters to incorporate the effect of unaccounted environmental variables in the analysis. Assuming that the spatial signature of these variables is broad-scaled, broad-scale Moran’s eigenvector maps (MEM) can be included as explanatory variables in the analysis as proxies for unmeasured environmental variables. We applied this approach to two data sets of the alpine plant Arabis alpina. The first consisted of 140 AFLP loci sampled at 130 sites across the European Alps (large scale). The second one consisted of 712 AFLP loci sampled at 93 sites (regional scale) in three mountain massifs (local scale) of the French Alps. For each scale, we regressed the frequencies of each AFLP allele on a set of eco-climatic and MEM variables as predictors. Twelve (large scale) and 11\% (regional scale) of all loci were detected as significantly correlated to at least one of the predictors ( {$>$} 0.5), and, except for one massif, 17\% at the local scale. After accounting for spatial effects, temperature and precipitation were the two major determinants of allele distributions. Our study shows how MEM models can account for unmeasured environmental variation in landscape genetics models.},

  abstract = {Understanding the processes and patterns of gene flow and local adaptation requires a detailed knowledge of how landscape characteristics structure populations. This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.},

Although we have begun to understand the molecular basis of adaptation in those species for which whole genome sequences are available, the molecular basis of adaptation is still poorly understood for most non-model species. In this paper, we outline major challenges and future research directions for correlating environmental factors with molecular markers to identify adaptive genetic variation, and point to research gaps in the application of landscape genetics to real-world problems arising from global change, such as the ability of organisms to adapt over rapid time scales. High throughput sequencing generates vast quantities of molecular data to address the challenge of studying adaptive genetic variation in non-model species.

Then, we describe available statistical approaches for integrating spatial dependence into landscape analyses of adaptive genetic variation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In malaria endemic areas, individuals are frequently asymptomatic and may be undetected by conventional microscopy or newer, rapid diagnostic tests. Molecular techniques allow a more accurate assessment of this asymptomatic parasite burden, the extent of which is important for malaria control. This study examines the relative prevalence of sub-microscopic level parasite carriage and clonal complexity of infections (multiplicity of infection) over a range of endemicities in a region of north-eastern Tanzania where altitude is an established proxy of malaria transmission. The PCR prevalence was then compared against other measures of transmission intensity collected in the same area. METHODS: This study used 1,121 blood samples collected from a previously conducted cross-sectional malario-metric survey during the short rainy season in 2001 from 13 villages (three at {$<$} 600 m, four at 600-1,200 m and six at {$>$} 1,200 m in altitude above sea level). Samples were analysed by PCR for carriage of parasites and multiplicity of infection. These data were compared with other measures of transmission intensity collected from the same area. RESULTS: Parasite prevalence was 34.7\% by PCR and 13.6\% by microscopy; a 2.5-fold difference in line with other recent observations. This fold difference was relatively consistent at the different altitude bands despite a marked decrease in parasite prevalence with altitude: {$<$} 600 m 70.9 vs 28.6, 600-1,200 m 35.5 vs 9.9, {$>$} 1,200 m 15.8 vs 5.9. The difference between parasite prevalence by PCR was 3.2 in individuals aged between 15 and 45 years (34.5 vs 10.9) compared with 2.5 in those aged 1-5 (34.0 vs 13.5) though this was not statistically significant. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) ranged from 1.2 to 3.7 and was positively associated with parasite prevalence assessed by both PCR and microscopy. There was no association of MOI and age.Village level PCR parasite prevalence was strongly correlated with altitude, sero-conversion rate and predicted entomological inoculation rate. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic, low density, multi-clone malaria infection was common in this study area. These infections are important as potential contributors to the infectious reservoir of parasites and need to be identified by control programmes especially in this era where malaria elimination is a focus. High throughput standardized PCR approaches are needed to identify individuals who are malaria carriers.},

  abstract = {Genomic surveillance of malaria parasites has demonstrated significant utility in recent years for tracking the spatial and temporal distribution of drug resistance markers, measuring population connectivity, detecting changes in transmission, and other use cases. The development of cost-effective genotyping panels for measuring genomic variation in Plasmodium vivax has lagged behind that of Plasmodium falciparum, despite the additional need in P. vivax to distinguish hypnozoite-driven relapse infections from reinfections or recrudescence following drug treatment. We have designed and validated an Illumina-based multiplexed PCR amplicon sequencing panel for P. vivax that incorporates over 150 amplicons covering a large collection of candidate drug resistance markers, amplicons used in other P. vivax genotyping panels, and amplicons capturing polymorphic regions with particular utility for spatial resolution of parasites from Latin America, a geographic focus of our work. The panel reliably generates genotypic data for patient samples with parasitemia levels as low as 10 parasites/ul, and is able to resolve genotypes for minor parasite strains in polyclonal infections, as determined with mock samples as well as authentic patient samples. We present in silico analyses of the enhanced capacity of this panel relative to two existing P. vivax panels to resolve the geographic population structure of parasites from Latin America. The panel does not make use of proprietary reagents and employs a protocol that is highly similar to that used for a comparable panel we previously developed for P. falciparum (AMPLseq). It also shares a common analysis workflow for amplicon data processing with the P. falciparum AMPLseq, and which may be downloaded from GitHub for local execution or accessed in a cloud-based analysis environment.},

  abstract = {Human movement impacts the spread and transmission of infectious diseases. Recently, a large reservoir of Plasmodium falciparum malaria was identified in a semi-arid region of northwestern Kenya historically considered unsuitable for malaria transmission. Understanding the sources and patterns of transmission attributable to human movement would aid in designing and targeting interventions to decrease the unexpectedly high malaria burden in the region. Toward this goal, polymorphic parasite genes (ama1, csp) in residents and passengers traveling to Central Turkana were genotyped by amplicon deep sequencing. Genotyping and epidemiological data were combined to assess parasite importation. The contribution of travel to malaria transmission was estimated by modelling case reproductive numbers inclusive and exclusive of travelers. P. falciparum was detected in 6.7\% (127/1891) of inbound passengers, including new haplotypes which were later detected in locally-transmitted infections. Case reproductive numbers approximated 1 and did not change when travelers were removed from transmission networks, suggesting that transmission is not fueled by travel to the region but locally endemic. Thus, malaria is not only prevalent in Central Turkana but also sustained by local transmission. As such, interrupting importation is unlikely to be an effective malaria control strategy on its own, but targeting interventions locally has the potential to drive down transmission.},

  abstract = {Crop biomass is increasingly being measured with surface reflectance data derived from multispectral broadband (MSBB) and hyperspectral narrowband (HNB) space-borne remotely sensed data to increase the accuracy and efficiency of crop yield models used in a wide array of agricultural applications. However, few studies compare the ability of MSBBs versus HNBs to capture crop biomass variability. Therefore, we used standard data mining techniques to identify a set of MSBB data from the IKONOS, GeoEye-1, Landsat ETM+, MODIS, WorldView-2 sensors and compared their performance with HNB data from the EO-1 Hyperion sensor in explaining crop biomass variability of four important field crops (rice, alfalfa, cotton, maize). The analysis employed two-band (ratio) vegetation indices (TBVIs) and multiband (additive) vegetation indices (MBVIs) derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and stepwise regression. Results demonstrated that HNB-derived TBVIs and MBVIs performed better than MSBB-derived TBVIs and MBVIs on a per crop basis and for the pooled data: overall, HNB TBVIs explained 5-31\% greater variability when compared with various MSBB TBVIs; and HNB MBVIs explained 3-33\% greater variability when compared with various MSBB MBVIs. The performance of MSBB MBVIs and TBVIs improved mildly, by combining spectral information across multiple sensors involving IKONOS, GeoEye-1, Landsat ETM+, MODIS, and WorldView-2. A number of HNBs that advance crop biomass modeling were determined. Based on the highest factor loadings on the first component of the SVD, the "red-edge" spectral range (700-740nm) centered at 722nm (bandwidth=10nm) stood out prominently, while five additional and distinct portions of the recorded spectral range (400-2500nm) centered at 539nm, 758nm, 914nm, 1130nm, 1320nm (bandwidth=10nm) were also important. The best HNB vegetation indices for crop biomass estimation involved 549 and 752nm for rice (R2=0.91); 925 and 1104nm for alfalfa (R2=0.81); 722 and 732nm for cotton (R2=0.97); and 529 and 895nm for maize (R2=0.94). The higher spectral resolution of the EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral sensor and the ability of users to choose distinct HNBs for improved crop biomass estimation outweigh the benefits that come with higher spatial resolution of MSBBs.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the use of time series of SAR images to map the flood temporal dynamics and the spatial distribution of vegetation over a large Amazonian floodplain. The region under study (3500~km2) presents a diversity of landscape units with open lakes, bogs, large meadows, savannahs, alluvial forests and terra firma forest, covered by 21 images acquired by J-ERS between 1993 and 1997. Ground data include in situ observations of vegetation structure and flood extent as well as water level records. Image analysis demonstrates that temporal variations of the radar backscatter can be used to monitor efficiently the flood extent regardless of the landscape units. Also, analysis of the backscatter temporal variation greatly reduces the confusion between smooth surfaces (e.g. open water bodies, bare soils) inherent to L-band backscatter. The mapping method is based on decision rules over two decision variables: 1) the mean backscatter coefficient computed over the whole time series; 2) the total change computed using an "Absolute Change" estimator. The first variable provides classification into rough vegetation types while the second variable yields a direct estimate of the intensity of change that is related to flood dynamics. The classifier is first applied to the whole time series to map the maximum and minimum flood extent by defining 3 flood conditions: never flooded (NF); occasionally flooded (OF); permanently flooded (PF). It also furnishes the broad land cover type: open water/bare soils/low vegetation/forest. The accuracy of the flood extent mapping shows a kappa value of 0.82. Then, the classifier is run iteratively on the OF pixels to monitor flood stages during which the occasionally flooded areas get submerged. The mapping accuracy is assessed on one intermediate flood stage, showing a precision in excess of 90\%. The importance of the time sampling for flood mapping is discussed along with the influence of SAR backscatter accuracy and the number of images. Then general guidelines for floodplain mapping are presented. By combining water level reports with maps of different flood stages the flooding pattern can be retrieved along with the vegetation succession processes. It is shown that the spatial distribution of vegetation communities is governed by flood stress and can be modelled as a function of the mean annual exposure to floods. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Although gully erosion is generally considered a major process of land degradation, its contribution to total soil loss by erosion has recently been a subject of much discussion. The lack of adequate methods for the documentation and monitoring of gullies resulted in the shortage of quantitative data. Therefore, a high-resolution remote sensing system for aerial surveys by blimp or kite has been developed which meets spatial and temporal image resolutions required for short-term gully monitoring. The objective of this paper is to examine the potential of a method using non-metric digital photogrammetry and GIS for gully surface modelling and monitoring. Two bank gullies representing different morphological types of gullies (V-shaped and U-shaped) were chosen from a dataset of gully systems in semi-arid Spain. The considerable relief energy and complex topography of the gullies in a natural, vegetated landscape were found to be a challenge to digital photogrammetric techniques, introducing errors which inhibit fully automated DEM generation. Using a hybrid method combining stereomatching for mass-point extraction with manual 3D editing and digitizing, high-resolution DEMs (5 and 7.5 cm pixel size) were created for the study sites. GIS analysis of the DEMs for different monitoring periods (2 to 4 years) allowed the computation of gully area and volume, as well as their changes with an accuracy and detail sufficient to represent the geomorphological forms and processes involved. Furthermore, the spatially continuous survey of the entire form offered the possibility of distinguishing different zones of activity both at the gully rim and within the gully interior, identifying patterns of erosion and deposition which indicate the limited use of headcut retreat rates for the assessment of sediment production on a short-term basis.},

  abstract = {The energy that sustains cancer cells is derived preferentially from glycolysis. This metabolic change, the Warburg effect, was one of the first alterations in cancer cells recognized as conferring a survival advantage. Here, we show that p53, one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancers, modulates the balance between the utilization of respiratory and glycolytic pathways. We identify Synthesis of Cytochrome c Oxidase 2 (SCO2) as the downstream mediator of this effect in mice and human cancer cell lines. SCO2 is critical for regulating the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) complex, the major site of oxygen utilization in the eukaryotic cell. Disruption of the SCO2 gene in human cancer cells with wild-type p53 recapitulated the metabolic switch toward glycolysis that is exhibited by p53-deficient cells. That SCO2 couples p53 to mitochondrial respiration provides a possible explanation for the Warburg effect and offers new clues as to how p53 might affect aging and metabolism. Cancer cells can survive in low-oxygen conditions because a defect in a common tumor suppressor inhibits mitochondrial respiration, allowing glycolysis to take place.

  abstract = {Cameroon, a west-central African country with a \textasciitilde{} 20 million population, is commonly regarded as 'Africa in miniature' due to the extensive biological and cultural diversities of whole Africa being present in a single-country setting. This country is inhabited by ancestral human lineages in unique eco-climatic conditions and diverse topography. Over 90 percent Cameroonians are at risk of malaria infection, and \textasciitilde{} 41 percent have at least one episode of malaria each year. Historically, the rate of malaria infection in Cameroon has fluctuated over the years; the number of cases was about 2 million in 2010 and 2011. The Cameroonian malaria control programme faces an uphill task due to high prevalence of multidrug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant malaria vectors. Above all, continued human migration from the rural to urban areas as well as population exchange with adjoining countries, high rate of ecological instabilities caused by deforestation, poor housing, lack of proper sanitation and drainage system might have resulted in the recent increase in incidences of malaria and other vector-borne diseases in Cameroon. The available data on eco-environmental variability and intricate malaria epidemiology in Cameroon reflect the situation in the whole of Africa, and warrant the need for in-depth study by using modern surveillance tools for meaningful basic understanding of the malaria triangle (host-parasite-vector-environment).},

Any such increases in agricultural productivity are likely to occur within a system that has limited room for growth and in a world with a climate that is different from that of today. Fundamental to achieving food and water security, is the capacity to monitor the health and condition of agricultural systems. While space-Agency based satellites have provided the backbone for earth observation over the last few decades, many developments in the field of high-resolution earth observation have been advanced by the commercial sector. These advances relate not just to technological developments in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), but also the advent of nano-satellite constellations that offer a radical shift in the way earth observations are now being retrieved. Such technologies present opportunities for improving our description of the water, energy and carbon cycles. Efforts towards developing new observational techniques and interpretative frameworks are required to provide the tools and information needed to improve the management and security of agricultural and related sectors. These developments are one of the surest ways to better manage, protect and preserve national food and water resources. Here we review the capabilities of recently deployed satellite systems and UAVs and examine their potential for application in precision agriculture.},

The WorldView constellation, operated by DigitalGlobe, images over 1.2 billion km2annually at {$<$} 2 m spatial resolution. Due to computation, data cost, and methodological concerns, VHR satellite data has mainly been used to produce needed geospatial information for site-specific phenomena. This project produced a VHR spatiotemporally explicit wall-to-wall cropland area map for the rainfed residential cropland mosaic of the Tigray Region, Ethiopia, which is comprised mostly of smallholder farms. Moderate resolution satellite data do not have adequate spatial resolution to capture the total area occupied by smallholder farms, i.e., farms with agricultural fields of ≤ 45 × 45 m in dimension. In order to accurately map smallholder cropped area over a large region, hundreds of VHR images spanning two or more years are needed. Sub-meter WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 segmentation results were combined with median phenology amplitude from Landsat 8 data to map cropped area. Over 2700 VHR WorldView-1, -2 data were obtained from the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) via the NextView license agreement and were processed from raw imagery to produce a smallholder crop map in \textasciitilde{} 1 week using a semi-automated method with the large computing capacity of the Advanced Data Analytics Platform. We estimated cropped area in Tigray to be 46\% with a commission error of 5\% ± 10\% and omission error of 15\% ± 12\%. This methodology is extensible to other regions with similar vegetation texture and can easily be expanded to run on much larger regions.},

Analyses of isolation by distance have typically either assumed spatial homogeneity for convenience or applied theoretically unjustified distance metrics to compensate for heterogeneity. Here I propose the isolation-by-resistance (IBR) model as an alternative for predicting equilibrium genetic structuring in complex landscapes. The model predicts a positive relationship between genetic differentiation and the resistance distance, a distance metric that exploits precise relationships between random walk times and effective resistances in electronic networks. As a predictor of genetic differentiation, the resistance distance is both more theoretically justified and more robust to spatial heterogeneity than Euclidean or least cost path-based distance measures. Moreover, the metric can be applied with a wide range of data inputs, including coarse-scale range maps, simple maps of habitat and nonhabitat within a species' range, or complex spatial datasets with habitats and barriers of differing qualities. The IBR model thus provides a flexible and efficient tool to account for habitat heterogeneity in studies of isolation by distance, improve understanding of how landscape characteristics affect genetic structuring, and predict genetic and evolutionary consequences of landscape change.},

However, while the method is often used to inform about historical demographic processes, little is known about the relationship between fundamental demographic parameters and the projection of samples onto the primary axes. Here I show that for SNP data the projection of samples onto the principal components can be obtained directly from considering the average coalescent times between pairs of haploid genomes. The result provides a framework for interpreting PCA projections in terms of underlying processes, including migration, geographical isolation, and admixture. I also demonstrate a link between PCA and Wright's fst and show that SNP ascertainment has a largely simple and predictable effect on the projection of samples. Using examples from human genetics, I discuss the application of these results to empirical data and the implications for inference.},

  abstract = {Human-aided transport is responsible for many contemporary species introductions, yet the contribution of human-aided transport to dispersal within non-native regions is less clear. Understanding dispersal dynamics for invasive species can streamline mitigation efforts by targeting routes that contribute disproportionally to spread. Because of its limited natural dispersal ability, rapid spread of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) has been attributed to human-aided transport, but until now, the relative roles of human-aided and natural movement have not been rigorously evaluated. Here, we use landscape genetics and information-theoretic model selection to evaluate 52 models representing 9240 pairwise dispersal paths among sites across the US range for Ae.~albopictus and show that recent gene flow reflects a combination of natural and human-aided dispersal. Highways and water availability facilitate dispersal at a broad spatial scale, but gene flow is hindered by forests at the current distributional limit (range edge) and by agriculture among sites within the mosquito's native climatic niche (range core). Our results show that highways are important to genetic structure between range-edge and range-core pairs, suggesting a role for human-aided mosquito transport to the range edge. In contrast, natural dispersal is dominant at smaller spatial scales, reflecting a shifting dominance to natural movement two decades after introduction. These conclusions highlight the importance of (i) early intervention for species introductions, particularly those with readily dispersed dormant stages and short generation times, and (ii) strict monitoring of commercial shipments for transported immature stages of Ae.~albopictus, particularly towards the northern edge of the US range.},

We review the state of the field and describe analytical frontiers that show promise for advancement, focusing on natural and human-altered ecosystems. Concepts fundamental to practicing landscape epidemiology are discussed, including spatial scale, static versus dynamic modeling, spatially implicit versus explicit approaches, selection of ecologically meaningful variables, and inference versus prediction. We highlight studies that have advanced the field by incorporating multiscale analyses, landscape connectivity, and dynamic modeling. Future research directions include understanding disease as a component of interacting ecological disturbances, scaling up the ecological impacts of disease, and examining disease dynamics as a coupled human-natural system.},

  abstract = {Plant disease resistance to pathogens such as fungi, bac- teria, and viruses often depends on whether the plant is able to recognize the pathogen early in the infection process. The recognition event leads to a rapid tissue necrosis at the site of infection, which is called the HR. The HR deprives the pathogen of nutrients and/or releases toxic molecules, thereby confining pathogen growth to a small region of the plant. This response provides resistance to the great majority of potential pathogens (nonhost or species resistance). For a given plant species, a much more limited number of true pathogens exhibit the ability to evade the host recognition system and grow extensively within the plant without evok- ing host necrosis at a11 or only after considerable delay. In this case, the plant exhibits susceptibility and the extensive growth of the successful pathogen can cause varying degrees of damage. However, certain races within pathogenic bacte- ria1 or funga1 species are recognized by certain cultivars or genotypes of the host plant species and the HR is triggered. These observations indicate that there is an ongqing evolution of the host plant's ability to recognize pathogen races that were previously unrecognized while the pathogen evolves to avoid recognition by a previously resistant host.},

Yet current global road maps are typically outdated or characterized by spatial bias in coverage. In the Global Roads Inventory Project we gathered, harmonized and integrated nearly 60 geospatial datasets on road infrastructure into a global roads dataset. The resulting dataset covers 222 countries and includes over 21 million km of roads, which is two to three times the total length in the currently best available country-based global roads datasets. We then related total road length per country to country area, population density, GDP and OECD membership, resulting in a regression model with adjusted R 2 of 0.90, and found that that the highest road densities are associated with densely populated and wealthier countries. Applying our regression model to future population densities and GDP estimates from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios, we obtained a tentative estimate of 3.0–4.7 million km additional road length for the year 2050. Large increases in road length were projected for developing nations in some of the world’s last remaining wilderness areas, such as the Amazon, the Congo basin and New Guinea. This highlights the need for accurate spatial road datasets to underpin strategic spatial planning in order to reduce the impacts of roads in remaining pristine ecosystems.},

Gene drive mosquitoes could eliminate malaria and were the most cost-effective intervention overall if the drive component was highly effective with at least 95\% X-shredder efficiency at relatively low fertility cost, and associated cost of deployment below 7.17 \$int per person per year.

  abstract = {This paper examines the potential of airborne videography as a remote sensing tool in a project aimed to develop a rapid and cost-e ff ective system for assessing and monitoring the conditions of crops, pastures and native forest areas in the agricultural region of Western Australia. This implies a close examination of current techniques for low cost / high resolution data capture, and the require- ments for image-based precision farming. The research approach comprises reviewing stress indicators that can be used as early signs of changes in the conditions of crops and pasture, and the identification of value-added products, such as vegetation indices, that can be used by farmers and land planners interested to know where field variations occur. Four vegetation indices, Namely Plant Pigment Ratio (PPR), Photosynthetic Vigour Ratio (PVR), the Normalized Di ff erence Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the green NDVI (NDVIg) are tested. Experimental results related to the identification and mapping of crop density variations, crop types, and variations in crop conditions due to the presence of weeds and dead standing vegetation are discussed. Statistical analysis ( T -test and multiple comparisons procedure using the Fisher LSD test, at a = 0.05) suggest the PVR as the best index to detect relative variations (e.g. high, medium, low) in crop density, followed by the NDVI. Results also show the indices ability to separate canola from lupins and wheat. Additionally, the PPR appears to detect the presence of weeds ( Arctotheca calendula ) in pasture and cereal crops, while NDVIg and NDVI can only identify weeds in pasture. The NDVI and NDVIg appear as the more sensitive indices to detect the presence of dead standing vegetation (stubble) in pasture. The status of high-resolution satellite imagery, as compared to airborne videography, for crop management applications, and main findings in regard to the potential of video-based vegetation indices to support precision farming, are presented as well.},

Current understanding of parasite evolution is impeded by the fact that a large fraction of the genome is either highly repetitive or highly variable and thus difficult to analyze using short-read sequencing technologies. Here, we describe a resource of deep sequencing data on parents and progeny from genetic crosses, which has enabled us to perform the first genome-wide, integrated analysis of SNP, indel and complex polymorphisms, using Mendelian error rates as an indicator of genotypic accuracy. These data reveal that indels are exceptionally abundant, being more common than SNPs and thus the dominant mode of polymorphism within the core genome. We use the high density of SNP and indel markers to analyze patterns of meiotic recombination, confirming a high rate of crossover events and providing the first estimates for the rate of non-crossover events and the length of conversion tracts. We observe several instances of meiotic recombination within copy number variants associated with drug resistance, demonstrating a mechanism whereby fitness costs associated with resistance mutations could be compensated and greater phenotypic plasticity could be acquired.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Humans living in regions with high falciparum malaria transmission intensity harbour multi-strain infections comprised of several genetically distinct malaria haplotypes. The number of distinct malaria parasite haplotypes identified from an infected human host at a given time is referred to as the complexity of infection (COI). In this study, an amplicon-based deep sequencing method targeting the Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (pfama1) was utilized to (1) investigate the relationship between P. falciparum prevalence and COI, (2) to explore the population genetic structure of P. falciparum parasites from malaria asymptomatic individuals participating in the 2007 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and (3) to explore selection pressures on geospatially divergent parasite populations by comparing AMA1 amino acid frequencies in the DRC and Mali. RESULTS: A total of 900 P. falciparum infections across 11 DRC provinces were examined. Deep sequencing of both individuals, for COI analysis, and pools of individuals, to examine population structure, identified 77 unique pfama1 haplotypes. The majority of individual infections (64.5\%) contained polyclonal (COI~{$>~$}1) malaria infections based on the presence of genetically distinct pfama1 haplotypes. A minimal correlation between COI and malaria prevalence as determined by sensitive real-time PCR was identified. Population genetic analyses revealed extensive haplotype diversity, the vast majority of which was shared across the sites. AMA1 amino acid frequencies were similar between parasite populations in the DRC and Mali. CONCLUSIONS: Amplicon-based deep sequencing is a useful tool for the detection of multi-strain infections that can aid in the understanding of antigen heterogeneity of potential malaria vaccine candidates, population genetics of malaria parasites, and factors that influence complex, polyclonal malaria infections. While AMA1 and other diverse markers under balancing selection may perform well for understanding COI, they may offer little geographic or temporal discrimination between parasite populations.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of malaria among the residents of the Lake Victoria basin remains high. The environment associated with the lake may maintain a high number of malaria vectors. Lake habitats including water hyacinths have been suspected to be the source of vectors. This study investigated whether malaria vectors breed in the lake habitats and adjacent backwater pools. Anopheline larvae were collected within the littoral zone of the lake and adjacent pools located along approximately 24.3 km of the lakeshore in western Kenya, and their breeding sites characterized. Three primary vector species, Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Anopheles funestus s.s., and three potential vectors, were found in the lake habitats. Unexpectedly, An. arabiensis was the most dominant vector species in the lake sampling sites. Its habitats were uncovered or covered with short grass. A potential secondary malaria vector, Anopheles rivulorum, dominated the water hyacinths in the lake. Most breeding sites in the lake were limited to areas that were surrounded by tall emergent plants, including trees, and those not exposed to waves. Nearly half of adjacent habitats were lagoons that were separated from the lake by sand bars. Lagoons contained a variety of microhabitats. Anopheles arabiensis dominated open habitats, whereas An. funestus s.s. was found mainly in vegetated habitats in lagoons. The current study confirmed that several breeding sites are associated with Lake Victoria. Given that Lake Victoria is the second largest lake in the world, the lake related habitats must be extensive; therefore, making targeted vector control difficult. Further exploration is necessary to estimate the effects of lake associated habitats on malaria transmission so as to inform a rational decision-making process for vector control.},

Quantifying the number of strains per host, or the multiplicity of infection (MOI), provides additional parasite indices for assessing transmission levels but it is challenging to measure accurately with current tools. This paper presents new laboratory and analytical methods for estimating the MOI of Plasmodium falciparum. METHODS: Based on 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identified as stable, unlinked targets across 12 of the 14 chromosomes within P. falciparum genome, three multiplex PCRs of short target regions and subsequent next generation sequencing (NGS) of the amplicons were developed. A bioinformatics pipeline including B4Screening pathway removed spurious amplicons to ensure consistent frequency calls at each SNP location, compiled amplicons by SNP site diversity, and performed algorithmic haplotype and strain reconstruction. The pipeline was validated by 108 samples generated from cultured-laboratory strain mixtures in different proportions and concentrations, with and without pre-amplification, and using whole blood and dried blood spots (DBS). The pipeline was applied to 273 smear-positive samples from surveys conducted in western Kenya, then providing results into StrainRecon Thresholding for Infection Multiplicity (STIM), a novel MOI estimator. RESULTS: The 24 barcode SNPs were successfully identified uniformly across the 12 chromosomes of P. falciparum in a sample using the pipeline. Pre-amplification and parasite concentration, while non-linearly associated with SNP read depth, did not influence the SNP frequency calls. Based on consistent SNP frequency calls at targeted locations, the algorithmic strain reconstruction for each laboratory-mixed sample had 98.5\% accuracy in dominant strains. STIM detected up to 5 strains in field samples from western Kenya and showed declining MOI over time (q\,{$<$}\,0.02), from 4.32 strains per infected person in 1996 to 4.01, 3.56 and 3.35 in 2001, 2007 and 2012, and a reduction in the proportion of samples with 5 strains from 57\% in 1996 to 18\% in 2012. CONCLUSION: The combined approach of new multiplex PCRs and NGS, the unique bioinformatics pipeline and STIM could identify 24 barcode SNPs of P. falciparum correctly and consistently.

These timetrees are inferred by using molecular sequences of pathogenic strains sampled at different times. That is, temporally sampled sequences enable the inference of sequence divergence times. Here, we present a new approach (RelTime with Dated Tips [RTDT]) to estimating pathogen timetrees based on a relative rate framework underlying the RelTime approach that is algebraic in nature and distinct from all other current methods. RTDT does not require many of the priors demanded by Bayesian approaches, and it has light computing requirements. In analyses of an extensive collection of computer-simulated datasets, we found the accuracy of RTDT time estimates and the coverage probabilities of their confidence intervals (CIs) to be excellent. In analyses of empirical datasets, RTDT produced dates that were similar to those reported in the literature. In comparative benchmarking with Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods (LSD, TreeTime, and treedater), we found that no method performed the best in every scenario. So, we provide a brief guideline for users to select the most appropriate method in empirical data analysis. RTDT is implemented for use via a graphical user interface and in high-throughput settings in the newest release of cross-platform MEGA X software, freely available from http://www.megasoftware.net.},

METHODS: Ten polymorphic P. falciparum microsatellite loci were genotyped in 268 infections from eight locations in four West African countries (Republic of Guinea, Guinea Bissau, The Gambia and Senegal), spanning a highly endemic forested region in the south to a low endemic Sahelian region in the north. Analysis was performed on proportions of mixed genotype infections, genotypic diversity among isolates, multilocus standardized index of association, and inter-population differentiation. RESULTS: Each location had similar levels of pairwise genotypic diversity among isolates, although there were many more mixed parasite genotype infections in the south. Apart from a few isolates that were virtually identical, the multilocus index of association was not significant in any population. Genetic differentiation between populations was low (most pairwise F(ST) values {$<$} 0.03), and an overall test for isolation by distance was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Although proportions of mixed genotype infections varied with endemicity as expected, population genetic structure was similar across the diverse sites. Very substantial reduction in transmission would be needed to cause fragmented or epidemic sub-structure in this region.},

  abstract = {Acetosyringone is a phenolic metabolite often found in plant apoplasts. Its oxidation by hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase results in a prolonged increase in the redox potential of the reaction mixture, similar to redox increases observed in tobacco suspension cells upon treatment with incompatible bacteria. Since high redox potentials, being oxidative, are generally detrimental to bacteria, the effect of acetosyringone oxidation on bacterial viability was examined. Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae was added to reaction mixtures containing acetosyringone, hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase and samples were removed to determine viability by dilution plating. Initial studies were done with low bacterial concentrations, 105CFUml-1, to ensure that scavenging of H2O2 was negligible and did not interfere with the reaction mixture. No colonies were formed by bacteria that had been added to reaction mixtures with acetosyringone ranging from 25 to 100μ. Examination of the bacteria by microscopy and flow cytometry, using fluorescent stains that indicate bacterial membrane integrity, suggested that these bacteria had maintained their membrane integrity. In addition they were able to respire based on oxygen uptake. When bacteria were added to on-going reaction mixtures at a time point after the prolonged redox response, the CFUml-1 increased indicating that a stable reaction product was not responsible for the non-culturability bioactive effect. Other bacterial isolates, P.s. pv. tabaci and Pseudomonas fluorescens, were less susceptible to the bioactive effect of the acetosyringone oxidation. Other phenolics were tested and had lesser degrees of bioactivity and in some cases reduced the bioactivity of acetosyringone oxidation. The 'viable but non-culturable' (VBNC) state of the bacteria in this study is compared to that described for other medical and plant pathogens.},

  abstract = {The rise of viral variants with altered phenotypes presents a significant public health challenge. In particular, the successive waves of COVID-19 have been driven by emerging variants of interest (VOIs) and variants of concern (VOCs), which are linked to modifications in phenotypic traits such as transmissibility, antibody resistance, and immune escape. Consequently, devising effective strategies to forecast emerging viral variants is critical for managing present and future epidemics. Although current evolutionary prediction tools mainly concentrate on single amino acid variants (SAVs) or isolated genomic changes, the observed history of VOCs and the extensive epistatic interactions within the SARS-CoV-2 genome suggest that predicting viral haplotypes, rather than individual mutations, is vital for efficient genomic surveillance. However, haplotype prediction is significantly more challenging problem, which precludes the use of traditional AI and Machine Learning approaches utilized in most mutation-based studies. This study demonstrates that by examining the community structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epistatic networks, it is feasible to efficiently detect or predict emerging haplotypes with altered transmissibility. These haplotypes can be linked to dense network communities, which become discernible significantly earlier than their associated viral variants reach noticeable prevalence levels. From these insights, we developed HELEN (Heralding Emerging Lineages in Epistatic Networks), a computational framework that identifies densely epistatically connected communities of SAV alleles and merges them into haplotypes using a combination of statistical inference, population genetics, and discrete optimization techniques. HELEN was validated by accurately identifying known SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and VOIs up to 10-12 months before they reached perceptible prevalence and were designated by the WHO. For example, our approach suggests that the spread of the Omicron haplotype or a closely related genomic variant could have been foreseen as early as the start of 2021, almost a year before its WHO designation. Moreover, HELEN offers greater scalability than phylogenetic lineage tracing methods, allowing for the analysis of millions of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Besides SARS-CoV-2, our methodology can be employed to detect emerging and circulating strains of any highly mutable pathogen with adequate genomic surveillance data.},

It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way.\&nbsp;Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

The Plasmodium falciparum Pfs47 gene has strong geographic population structure, because only those parasites with Pfs47 haplotypes compatible with the mosquito vector species in a given continent are efficiently transmitted. Analysis of 4,971 world-wide Pfs47 sequences identified two SNPs (at 707 and 725\,bp) as sufficient to establish the likely continent of origin of P. falciparum isolates. Pfs47 sequences from Africa, Asia, and the New World presented more that 99\% frequency of distinct combinations of the SNPs 707 and 725 genotypes. Interestingly, Papua New Guinea Pfs47 sequences have the highest diversity in SNPs 707 and 725. Accurate and reproducible High-Resolution Melting (HRM) assays were developed to genotype Pfs47 SNPs 707 and 725 in laboratory and field samples, to assess the geographic origin and risk of local transmission of imported P. falciparum malaria cases.},

Previous approaches to reconstructing transmission trees have assumed all infections in the study area originated from a single introduction and that a large fraction of cases were observed. There are as yet no approaches appropriate for endemic situations in which a disease is already well established in a host population and in which there may be multiple origins of infection, or that can enumerate unobserved infections missing from the sample. Our proposed framework addresses these shortcomings, enabling reconstruction of partially observed transmission trees and estimating the number of cases missing from the sample. Analyses of simulated datasets show the method to be accurate in identifying direct transmissions, while introductions and transmissions via one or more unsampled intermediate cases could be identified at high to moderate levels of case detection. When applied to partial genome sequences of rabies virus sampled from an endemic region of South Africa, our method reveals several distinct transmission cycles with little contact between them, and direct transmission over long distances suggesting significant anthropogenic influence in the movement of infected dogs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria cases and deaths decreased dramatically in recent years, largely due to effective vector control interventions. Persistence of transmission after good coverage has been achieved with high-quality vector control interventions, namely insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying, poses a significant challenge to malaria elimination efforts. To understand when and where remaining transmission is occurring, it is necessary to look at vector and human behaviour, and where they overlap. To date, a review of human behaviour related to residual malaria transmission has not been conducted. METHODS: Studies were identified through PubMed and Google Scholar. Hand searches were conducted for all references cited in articles identified through the initial search. The review was limited to English language articles published between 2000 and 2017. Publications with primary data from a malaria endemic setting in sub-Saharan Africa and a description of night time human behaviours were included. RESULTS: Twenty-six publications were identified that met inclusion criteria. Study results fit into two broad categories: when and where people are exposed to malaria vectors and what people are doing at night that may increase their contact with malaria vectors. Among studies that quantified human-vector interaction, a majority of exposure occurred indoors during sleeping hours for unprotected individuals, with some variation across time, contexts, and vector species. Common night time activities across settings included household chores and entertainment during evening hours, as well as livelihood and large-scale socio-cultural events that can last throughout the night. Shifting sleeping patterns associated with travel, visitors, illness, farming practices, and outdoor sleeping, which can impact exposure and use of prevention measures, were described in some locations. CONCLUSIONS: While the importance of understanding human-vector interaction is well-established, relatively few studies have included human behaviour when measuring exposure to malaria vectors. Broader application of a standardized approach to measuring human-vector interaction could provide critical information on exposure across settings and over time. In-depth understanding of night time activities that occur during times when malaria vectors are active and barriers to prevention practices in different contexts should also be considered. This information is essential for targeting existing interventions and development and deployment of appropriate complementary prevention tools.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the epidemiology of malaria through the molecular force of the blood-stage infection of Plasmodium vivax (molFOB) may provide a detailed assessment of malaria transmission. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigated risk factors and spatial-temporal patterns of incidence of Plasmodium infection and clinical malaria episodes in three peri-urban communities of Manaus, Western Brazilian Amazon. METHODS: Monthly samples were collected in a cohort of 1,274 individuals between April 2013 and March 2014. DNA samples were subject to Plasmodium species. molFOB was calculated by counting the number of genotypes observed on each visit, which had not been present in the preceding two visits and adjusting these counts by the respective times-at-risk. FINDINGS: Respectively, 77.8\% and 97.2\% of the population remained free of P. vivax and P. falciparum infection. Expected heterozygosity for P. vivax was 0.69 for MSP1\_F3 and 0.86 for MS2. Multiplicity of infection in P. vivax was close to the value of 1. The season was associated with P. vivax positivity [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.6 (1.9-5.7)] and clinical disease [aHR 10.6 (2.4-47.2)]. P. falciparum infection was associated with previous malarial episodes [HR 9.7 (4.5-20.9)]. Subjects who reported possession of a bed net [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.6 (1.2-2.2)] or previous malaria episodes [IRR 3.0 (2.0-4.5)] were found to have significantly higher P. vivax molFOB. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Overall, P. vivax infection prevailed in the area and infections were mostly observed as monoclonal. Previous malaria episodes were associated with significantly higher P. vivax molFOB.},

The vital rates of these ectothermic vectors and parasites respond strongly and nonlinearly to temperature and therefore to climate change. Here, we review how trait-based approaches can synthesise and mechanistically predict the temperature dependence of transmission across vectors, pathogens, and environments. We present 11 pathogens transmitted by 15 different mosquito species – including globally important diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika – synthesised from previously published studies. Transmission varied strongly and unimodally with temperature, peaking at 23–29ºC and declining to zero below 9–23ºC and above 32–38ºC. Different traits restricted transmission at low versus high temperatures, and temperature effects on transmission varied by both mosquito and parasite species. Temperate pathogens exhibit broader thermal ranges and cooler thermal minima and optima than tropical pathogens. Among tropical pathogens, malaria and Ross River virus had lower thermal optima (25–26ºC) while dengue and Zika viruses had the highest (29ºC) thermal optima. We expect warming to increase transmission below thermal optima but decrease transmission above optima. Key directions for future work include linking mechanistic models to field transmission, combining temperature effects with control measures, incorporating trait variation and temperature variation, and investigating climate adaptation and migration.},

  abstract = {Despite wide-scale control and elimination efforts, the global decline in malaria has stagnated in recent years. There is a strong need for malaria molecular surveillance in endemic regions to address the threats posed by antimalarial drug and diagnostic resistance, and to strategically prioritise the limited resources for malaria control programs. Meanwhile, non-endemic regions are not only being faced with an increasing number of travel-related malaria cases, in conjunction with adverse clinical outcomes, but also with rare cases of autochthonous transmission. To address these issues, we present the SUrveillance of Molecular epidemiology of Malaria In Travelers (SUMMIT) project. Travelers present an as of yet untapped resource of diverse genomic information on the Plasmodium parasite, which allows for close-to-real-time data collection and sharing, as well as the standardization of lab and bioinformatics methodologies. We aim to establish a pioneering platform for the routine systematic surveillance of travel-related malaria, which combines parasite whole-genome sequencing data with epidemiological patient data. The platform will be enabled through a global network of travel clinics ( GeoSentinel ), embrace FAIR data sharing principles and be supported by open and reproducible bioinformatics analysis and reporting pipelines (built using Nextflow and powered by nf-core’s components and best practices). We will leverage this continuously growing and global-spanning resource to monitor the emergence and spread of clinically-relevant markers, develop machine learning tools to trace parasite origins and conduct studies on treatment failure. Our approach is complementary to existing surveillance approaches and strives to increase the geographic, temporal and genetic resolution of the available genomic data and function as a sentinel system to aid preparedness efforts for reactive and coordinated responses to outbreaks. Our ultimate goal is to provide an up-to-date and accessible resource containing actionable data that can facilitate further malaria research, inform case management, prioritise efficacy studies and aid in surveillance and control efforts.},

Natural and artificial wetlands are of high importance for different livelihoods, particularly during the dry season, from October/November until May. However, wetlands largely go unmonitored. In this work, remote sensing is used to monitor wetlands in semiarid Burkina Faso over large areal extents along a gradient of different rainfall and land use characteristics. Time series of data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) from 2000 to 2012 is used for near-infrared (NIR)-based water monitoring using a latitudinal threshold gradient approach. The occurrence of 21 new water bodies with a size larger than 0.5 km2 over the 13-year analysis period results from a postclassification change detection. Yearly cumulative spatiotemporal analysis shows lower water extents in the drought seasons of 2000-2001, 2004-2005, and 2011-2012. Multiple wetlands indicate a positive trend toward a larger yearly maximum area, but a negative trend toward shorter flooding duration. Such a negative trend is observed particularly for natural wetlands. The temporal behavior of five selected case studies demonstrates that monthly negative anomalies of watercovered areas coincide with the occurrence of drought seasons. The successful application of remote sensing time series as a tool to monitor wetlands in semiarid regions is presented, and the potential of novel early warning indicators of drought from remote sensing is demonstrated.},

Identifying these hotspots of malaria transmission would permit targeting of interventions and a more rapid reduction in malaria burden across the whole community. This study set out to compare different statistical methods of hotspot detection (SaTScan, kernel smoothing, weighted local prevalence) using different indicators (PCR positivity, AMA-1 and MSP-1 antibodies) for prediction of infection the following year. METHODS: Two full surveys of four villages in Mwanza, Tanzania were completed over consecutive years, 2010-2011. In both surveys, infection was assessed using nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). In addition in 2010, serologic markers (AMA-1 and MSP-119 antibodies) of exposure were assessed. Baseline clustering of infection and serological markers were assessed using three geospatial methods: spatial scan statistics, kernel analysis and weighted local prevalence analysis. Methods were compared in their ability to predict infection in the second year of the study using random effects logistic regression models, and comparisons of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for each model. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the effect of varying radius size for the kernel and weighted local prevalence methods and maximum population size for the spatial scan statistic. RESULTS: Guided by AUC values, the kernel method and spatial scan statistics appeared to be more predictive of infection in the following year. Hotspots of PCR-detected infection and seropositivity to AMA-1 were predictive of subsequent infection. For the kernel method, a 1 km window was optimal. Similarly, allowing hotspots to contain up to 50\% of the population was a better predictor of infection in the second year using spatial scan statistics than smaller maximum population sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Clusters of AMA-1 seroprevalence or parasite prevalence that are predictive of infection a year later can be identified using geospatial models. Kernel smoothing using a 1 km window and spatial scan statistics both provided accurate prediction of future infection.},

  abstract = {Background: The burden of malaria has decreased dramatically within the past several years in parts of subSaharan Africa. Further malaria control will require targeted control strategies based on evidence of risk. The objective of this study was to identify environmental risk factors for malaria transmission using remote sensing technologies to guide malaria control interventions in a region of declining burden of malaria. Methods: Satellite images were used to construct a sampling frame for the random selection of households enrolled in prospective longitudinal and cross-sectional surveys of malaria parasitaemia in Southern Province, Zambia. A digital elevation model (DEM) was derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission version 3 DEM and used for landscape characterization, including landforms, elevation, aspect, slope, topographic wetness, topographic position index and hydrological models of stream networks. Results: A total of 768 individuals from 128 randomly selected households were enrolled over 21 months, from the end of the rainy season in April 2007 through December 2008. Of the 768 individuals tested, 117 (15.2\%) were positive by malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Individuals residing within 3.75 km of a third order stream were at increased risk of malaria. Households at elevations above the baseline elevation for the region were at decreasing risk of having RDT-positive residents. Households where new infections occurred were overlaid on a risk map of RDT positive households and incident infections were more likely to be located in high-risk areas derived from prevalence data. Based on the spatial risk map, targeting households in the top 80th percentile of malaria risk would require malaria control interventions directed to only 24\% of the households. Conclusions: Remote sensing technologies can be used to target malaria control interventions in a region of declining malaria transmission in southern Zambia, enabling a more efficient use of resources for malaria elimination.},

In this paper, we skip the segmentation step and consider that we have got a precise delimitation of plots that have a homogeneous content. To classify these plots, we have used expert knowledge in agronomy combined with image information in a decision tree. Classification criteria were based on parameters resulting from the Fourier transform analysis or vegetation indices, derived as one single descriptor for the whole plot. As a conclusion, the proposed methodology was found capable of classification and characterization of tree crops, provided the trees are clearly seen from above, and their planting is regular enough to give a response with Fourier analysis.},

  abstract = {Genotyping Plasmodium falciparum parasites in longitudinal studies provides a robust approach to estimating force of infection (FOI) in the presence of superinfections. The molecular parameter (mol)FOI, defined as the number of new P. falciparum clones acquired over time, describes basic malaria epidemiology and is suitable for measuring outcomes of interventions. This study was designed to test whether (mol)FOI influenced the risk of clinical malaria episodes and how far (mol)FOI reflected environmental determinants of transmission, such as seasonality and small-scale geographical variation or effects of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Two hundred sixty-four children 1-3 y of age from Papua New Guinea were followed over 16 mo. Individual parasite clones were tracked longitudinally by genotyping. On average, children acquired 5.9 (SD 9.6) new P. falciparum infections per child per y. (mol)FOI showed a pronounced seasonality, was strongly reduced in children using ITNs (incidence rate ratio, 0.49; 95\% confidence interval, [0.38, 0.61]), increased with age, and significantly varied within villages (P = 0.001). The acquisition of new parasite clones was the major factor determining the risk of clinical illness (incidence rate ratio, 2.12; 95\% confidence interval, [1.93, 2.31]). Adjusting for individual differences in (mol)FOI completely explained spatial variation, age trends, and the effect of ITN use. This study highlights the suitability of (mol)FOI as a measure of individual exposure and its central role in malaria epidemiology. It has substantial advantages over entomological measures in studies of transmission patterns, and could be used in analyses of host variation in susceptibility, in field efficacy trials of novel interventions or vaccines, and for evaluating intervention effects.},

  abstract = {Soil salinity is a global threat to agricultural production and necessitates the monitoring thereof. Saline conditions in South African irrigation schemes generally occur in small patches (some only a few metres in diameter) and this study, which forms part of a Water Research Commission (WRC) project, evaluates the use of very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, in particular those produced by the WorldView 2 (WV2) sensor, for the detection of salt accumulation in irrigated areas. A range of features derived from the WV2 image were evaluated, namely 8 WV2 bands, 10 vegetation indices (VIs), 25 texture measures and 2 principle component analysis (PCA) components. These features were generated at six spatial resolutions (0.5 m, 2 m, 6 m, 10 m, 15 m and 20 m) to investigate the value of high spatial resolution for detecting affected areas. The relationships between the image features and electric conductivity measurements of 30 soil samples were studied by means of regression analysis and classification and regression tree (CART) modelling. The regression analysis results showed that a spatial resolution of 6 m or higher is ideal when VIs are used as input. When texture measures are used, higher spatial resolution (0.5 m) produced better models. The regression results also showed that the relatively high spectral resolution of the WV2 sensor (compared to other VHR sensors) did not provide a significant improvement in accuracy. The CART results provided a categorical quantification of salt accumulation and showed that VIs generated at 0.5 m resolution were the best features to use. Because the use of WV2 images is not financially viable for operational use in very large irrigation schemes, the study concludes with some guidelines on the spectral and spatial requirements of images when monitoring salt accumulation in irrigation schemes with similar conditions.},

The parasite's short generation time, coupled with a high cross-over rate, can cause rapid LD break-down. However, observations of low genetic variation have led to suggestions of effective clonality: selfing, population admixture, and selection may preserve LD in populations. Indeed, extensive LD surrounding drug-resistant genes has been observed, indicating that recombination and selection play important roles in shaping recent parasite genome evolution. These studies, however, provide only limited information about haplotype variation at local scales. Here we describe the first (to our knowledge) chromosome-wide SNP haplotype and population recombination maps for a global collection of malaria parasites, including the 3D7 isolate, whose genome has been sequenced previously. The parasites are clustered according to continental origin, but alternative groupings were obtained using SNPs at 37 putative transporter genes that are potentially under selection. Geographic isolation and highly variable multiple infection rates are the major factors affecting haplotype structure. Variation in effective recombination rates is high, both among populations and along the chromosome, with recombination hotspots conserved among populations at chromosome ends. This study supports the feasibility of genome-wide association studies in some parasite populations.},

  abstract = {Explaining functional connectivity among occupied habitats is crucial for understanding metapopulation dynamics and species ecology. Landscape genetics has primarily focused on elucidating how ecological features between observations influence gene flow. Functional connectivity, however, may be the result of both these between-site (landscape resistance) landscape characteristics and at-site (patch quality) landscape processes that can be captured using network based models. We test hypotheses of functional connectivity that include both between-site and at-site landscape processes in metapopulations of Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) by employing a novel justification of gravity models for landscape genetics (eight microsatellite loci, 37 sites, n = 441). Primarily used in transportation and economic geography, gravity models are a unique approach as flow (e.g. gene flow) is explained as a function of three basic components: distance between sites, production/attraction (e.g. at-site landscape process) and resistance (e.g. between-site landscape process). The study system contains a network of nutrient poor high mountain lakes where we hypothesized a short growing season and complex topography between sites limit R. luteiventris gene flow. In addition, we hypothesized production of offspring is limited by breeding site characteristics such as the introduction of predatory fish and inherent site productivity. We found that R. luteiventris connectivity was negatively correlated with distance between sites, presence of predatory fish (at-site) and topographic complexity (between-site). Conversely, site productivity (as measured by heat load index, at-site) and growing season (as measured by frost-free period between-sites) were positively correlated with gene flow. The negative effect of predation and positive effect of site productivity, in concert with bottleneck tests, support the presence of source-sink dynamics. In conclusion, gravity models provide a powerful new modelling approach for examining a wide range of both basic and applied questions in landscape genetics.},

However, estimating key parameters such as allele frequencies, multiplicity of infection (MOI), and within-host relatedness from genetic data is challenging, particularly in the presence of multiple related coinfecting strains. Existing methods often rely on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and do not account for within-host relatedness.We present Multiplicity Of Infection and allele frequency REcovery (MOIRE), a Bayesian approach to estimate allele frequencies, MOI, and within-host relatedness from genetic data subject to experimental error. MOIRE accommodates both polyallelic and SNP data, making it applicable to diverse genotyping panels. We also introduce a novel metric, the effective MOI (eMOI), which integrates MOI and within-host relatedness, providing a robust and interpretable measure of genetic diversity. Extensive simulations and real-world data from a malaria study in Namibia demonstrate the superior performance of MOIRE over naive estimation methods, accurately estimating MOI up to seven with moderate-sized panels of diverse loci (e.g. microhaplotypes). MOIRE also revealed substantial heterogeneity in population mean MOI and mean relatedness across health districts in Namibia, suggesting detectable differences in transmission dynamics. Notably, eMOI emerges as a portable metric of within-host diversity, facilitating meaningful comparisons across settings when allele frequencies or genotyping panels differ. Compared to existing software, MOIRE enables more comprehensive insights into within-host diversity and population structure.MOIRE is available as an R package at https://eppicenter.github.io/moire/.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria vector control has been implemented chiefly through indoor interventions targeting primary vectors resulting in population declines-pointing to a possible greater proportional contribution to transmission by secondary malaria vectors with their predominant exophagic and exophilic traits. With a historical focus on primary vectors, there is paucity of data on secondary malaria vectors in many countries in Africa. This study sought to determine~the species compositions and bionomic traits, including proportions infected with Plasmodium falciparum and phenotypic insecticide resistance, of secondary vectors in three sites with high malaria transmission in Kisumu County, western Kenya. METHODS: Cross-sectional sampling of adult Anopheles was conducted using indoor and outdoor CDC light traps (CDC-LT) and animal-baited traps (ABTs) in Kakola-Ombaka and Kisian, while larvae were sampled in Ahero. Secondary vectors captured were exposed to permethrin using WHO bioassays and then analyzed by ELISA to test for proportions infected with P. falciparum sporozoites. All Anopheles were identified to species using morphological keys with a subset being molecularly identified using ITS2 and CO1 sequencing for species identification. RESULTS: Two morphologically identified secondary vectors captured-An. coustani and An. pharoensis-were determined to consist of four species molecularly. These included An. christyi, An. sp. 15 BSL-2014, an unidentified member of the An. coustani complex (An. cf. coustani) and a species similar to that of An. pharoensis and An. squamosus (An. cf. pharoensis). Standardized (Anopheles per trap per night) capture rates demonstrate higher proportions of secondary vectors across most trapping methods-with overall indoor and outdoor CDC-LTs and ABT captures composed of 52.2\% (n\,=\,93), 78.9\% (n\,=\,221) and 58.1\% (n\,=\,573) secondary vectors respectively. Secondary vectors were primarily caught outdoors. The overall proportion of secondary vectors with P. falciparum sporozoite was 0.63\% (n\,=\,5), with the unidentified species An. cf. pharoensis, determined to carry Plasmodium. Overall secondary vectors were susceptible to permethrin with a\,{$>$}\,99\% mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Given their high densities, endophily equivalent to primary vectors, higher exophily and Plasmodium-positive proportions, secondary vectors may contribute substantially to malaria transmission. Unidentified species demonstrate the need for further morphological and molecular identification studies towards further characterization. Continued monitoring is essential for understanding their temporal contributions to transmission, the possible elevation of some to primary vectors and the development of insecticide resistance.},

  abstract = {Ponds and lakes are abundant in Arctic permafrost lowlands. They play an important role in Arctic wetland ecosystems by regulating carbon, water, and energy fluxes and providing freshwater habitats. However, ponds, i.e., waterbodies with surface areas smaller than 1. 0 × 104 m2, have not been inventoried on global and regional scales. The Permafrost Region Pond and Lake (PeRL) database presents the results of a circum-Arctic effort to map ponds and lakes from modern (2002–2013) high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery with a resolution of 5 m or better. The database also includes historical imagery from 1948 to 1965 with a resolution of 6 m or better. PeRL includes 69 maps covering a wide range of environmental conditions from tundra to boreal regions and from continuous to discontinuous permafrost zones. Waterbody maps are linked to regional permafrost landscape maps which provide information on permafrost extent, ground ice volume, geology, and lithology. This paper describes waterbody classification and accuracy, and presents statistics of waterbody distribution for each site. Maps of permafrost landscapes in Alaska, Canada, and Russia are used to extrapolate waterbody statistics from the site level to regional landscape units. PeRL presents pond and lake estimates for a total area of 1. 4 × 106 km2 across the Arctic, about 17 \% of the Arctic lowland ( {$<$} 300 m a.s.l.) land surface area. PeRL waterbodies with sizes of 1. 0 × 106 m2 down to 1. 0 × 102 m2 contributed up to 21 \% to the total water fraction. Waterbody density ranged from 1. 0 × 10 to 9. 4 × 101 km−2. Ponds are the dominant waterbody type by number in all landscapes representing 45–99 \% of the total waterbody number. The implementation of PeRL size distributions in land surface models will greatly improve the investigation and projection of surface inundation and carbon fluxes in permafrost lowlands.

  abstract = {In using traditional digital classification algorithms, a researcher typically encounters serious issues in identifying urban land cover classes employing high resolution data. A normal approach is to use spectral information alone and ignore spatial information and a group of pixels that need to be considered together as an object. We used QuickBird image data over a central region in the city of Phoenix, Arizona to examine if an object-based classifier can accurately identify urban classes. To demonstrate if spectral information alone is practical in urban classification, we used spectra of the selected classes from randomly selected points to examine if they can be effectively discriminated. The overall accuracy based on spectral information alone reached only about 63.33\%. We employed five different classification procedures with the object-based paradigm that separates spatially and spectrally similar pixels at different scales. The classifiers to assign land covers to segmented objects used in the study include membership functions and the nearest neighbor classifier. The object-based classifier achieved a high overall accuracy (90.40\%), whereas the most commonly used decision rule, namely maximum likelihood classifier, produced a lower overall accuracy (67.60\%). This study demonstrates that the object-based classifier is a significantly better approach than the classical per-pixel classifiers. Further, this study reviews application of different parameters for segmentation and classification, combined use of composite and original bands, selection of different scale levels, and choice of classifiers. Strengths and weaknesses of the object-based prototype are presented and we provide suggestions to avoid or minimize uncertainties and limitations associated with the approach.},

Within this genus, rabies viruses circulate in a diverse set of mammalian reservoir hosts, is present worldwide, and is almost always fatal in non-vaccinated humans. Approximately 59,000 people are still estimated to die from rabies each year, leading to a global initiative to work towards the goal of zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030, requiring scientific efforts from different research fields. The past decade has seen a much increased use of phylogeographic and phylodynamic analyses to study the evolution and spread of rabies virus. We here review published studies in these research areas, making a distinction between the geographic resolution associated with the available sequence data. We pay special attention to environmental factors that these studies found to be relevant to the spread of rabies virus. Importantly, we highlight a knowledge gap in terms of applying these methods when all required data were available but not fully exploited. We conclude with an overview of recent methodological developments that have yet to be applied in phylogeographic and phylodynamic analyses of rabies virus.},

  abstract = {Kenya has, in the last decade, made tremendous progress in the fight against malaria. Nevertheless, continued surveillance of the genetic diversity and population structure of Plasmodium falciparum is required to refine malaria control and to adapt and improve elimination strategies. Twelve neutral microsatellite loci were genotyped in 201 P.~falciparum isolates obtained from the Kenyan-Ugandan border (Busia) and from two inland malaria-endemic sites situated in western (Nyando) and coastal (Msambweni) Kenya. Analyses were done to assess the genetic diversity (allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, [He ]), multilocus linkage disequilibrium ( I S A  ) and population structure. A similarly high degree of genetic diversity was observed among the three parasite populations surveyed (mean He ~=~0.76; P~{$>~$}0.05). Except in Msambweni, random association of microsatellite loci was observed, indicating high parasite out-breeding. Low to moderate genetic structure (FST ~ =~0.022-0.076; P~{$<~$}0.0001) was observed with only 5\% variance in allele frequencies observed among the populations. This study shows that the genetic diversity of P.~falciparum populations at the Kenyan-Ugandan border is comparable to the parasite populations from inland Kenya. In addition, high genetic diversity, panmixia and weak population structure in this study highlight the fitness of Kenyan P.~falciparum populations to successfully withstand malaria control interventions.},

  abstract = {The use of antimalarial drugs is an effective strategy in the fight against malaria. However, selection of drug resistant parasites is a constant threat to the continued use of this approach. Antimalarial drugs are used not only to treat infections but also as part of population-level strategies to reduce malaria transmission toward elimination. While there is strong evidence that the ongoing use of antimalarial drugs increases the risk of the emergence and spread of drug-resistant parasites, it is less clear how population-level use of drug-based interventions like seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) or mass drug administration (MDA) may contribute to drug resistance or loss of drug efficacy. Critical to sustained use of drug-based strategies for reducing the burden of malaria is the surveillance of population-level signals related to transmission reduction and resistance selection. Here we focus on Plasmodium falciparum and discuss the genetic signatures of a parasite population that are correlated with changes in transmission and related to drug pressure and resistance as a result of drug use. We review the evidence for MDA and SMC contributing to malaria burden reduction and drug resistance selection and examine the use and impact of these interventions in Senegal. Throughout we consider best strategies for ongoing surveillance of both population and resistance signals in the context of different parasite population parameters. Finally, we propose a roadmap for ongoing surveillance during population-level drug-based interventions to reduce the global malaria burden.},

Reference genomes now exist for all human malaria parasites and nearly half of the \textasciitilde 40 important vectors around the world. As a foundation for genetic diversity studies, these reference genomes have helped advance our understanding of basic disease biology and drug and insecticide resistance, and have informed vaccine development efforts. Population genomic data are increasingly being used to guide our understanding of malaria epidemiology, for example by assessing connectivity between populations and the efficacy of parasite and vector interventions. The potential value of these applications to malaria control strategies, together with the increasing diversity of genomic data types and contexts in which data are being generated, raise both opportunities and challenges in the field. This Review discusses advances in malaria genomics and explores how population genomic data could be harnessed to further support global disease control efforts.},

We observe approximately twice as much SNP diversity among these isolates as we do among a comparable collection of isolates of P. falciparum, a malaria-causing parasite that results in higher mortality. This indicates a distinct history of global colonization and/or a more stable demographic history for P. vivax relative to P. falciparum, which is thought to have undergone a recent population bottleneck. The SNP diversity, as well as additional microsatellite and gene family variability, suggests a capacity for greater functional variation in the global population of P. vivax. These findings warrant a deeper survey of variation in P. vivax to equip disease interventions targeting the distinctive biology of this neglected but major pathogen.},

It is defined as D = -logeI, where I is the normalized identity of genes between two populations. This genetic distance measures the accumulated allele differences per locus. If the rate of gene substitution per year is constant, it is linearly related to the divergence time between populations under sexual isolation. It is also linearly related to geographical distance or area in some migration models. Since D is a measure of the accumulated number of codon differences per locus, it can also be estimated from data on amino acid sequences in proteins even for a distantly related species. Thus, if enough data are available, genetic distance between any pair of organisms can be measured in terms of D. This measure is applicable to any kind of organism without regard to ploidy or mating scheme.},

  abstract = {Global food production in the developing world occurs within sub-hectare fields that are difficult to identify with moderate resolution satellite imagery. Knowledge about the distribution of these fields is critical in food security programs. We developed a semi-automated image segmentation approach using wall-to-wall sub-meter imagery with high-performance computing to map crop area (CA) throughout Tigray, Ethiopia that encompasses over 41,000 km2. Multiple processing streams were tested to minimize mapping error while applying five unique smoothing kernels to capture differences in land surface texture associated to CA. Typically, very-small fields (mean {$<$} 2 ha) have a smooth image roughness compared to natural scrub/shrub woody vegetation at the \textasciitilde 1 m scale and these features can be segmented in panchromatic imagery with multi-level histogram thresholding. Multi-temporal very-high resolution (VHR) panchromatic imagery with multi-spectral VHR are sufficient in extracting critical CA information needed in food security programs. A 2011 to 2015 CA map was produced, using over 3000 WorldView-1 panchromatic images wall-to-wall in 1/2° mosaics for Tigray, Ethiopia. CA was evaluated with nearly 3000 WorldView-2 2 m multispectral 250 × 250 m image subsets by seven expert interpretations, and with in-situ global positioning system photography. CA estimates ranged from 32 to 41\% in sub regions of Tigray with median maximum per bin commission and omission errors of 11\% and 1\% respectively, with most of the error occurring in bins {$<$}15\%. This empirical, simple, and low direct cost approach via U.S. government license agreement to access commercial VHR data, could be a viable big-data high-performance computing methodology to extract wall-to-wall CA for other regions of the world that have very-small agriculture fields with similar image texture.},

Rice growth has a distinct influence on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter images, and time-series analysis of C-band images has been successfully employed to map rice fields. The poor data availability on regional scales is a major drawback of this method. We devised an approach to classify paddy rice with the use of all available Envisat ASAR WSM (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar Wide Swath Mode) data for our study area, the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. We used regression-based incidence angle normalization and temporal averaging to combine acquisitions from multiple tracks and years. A crop phenology-based classifier has been applied to this time series to detect single-, double- and triple-cropped rice areas (one to three harvests per year), as well as dates and lengths of growing seasons. Our classification has an overall accuracy of 85.3\% and a kappa coefficient of 0.74 compared to a reference dataset and correlates highly with official rice area statistics at the provincial level (R² of 0.98). SAR-based time-series analysis allows accurate mapping and monitoring of rice areas even under adverse atmospheric conditions.},

This study investigated the relationship between asymptomatic P. falciparum carriage and subsequent clinical malaria episodes in Dielmo and Ndiop villages in Senegal.The study used a total of 2,792 venous and capillary blood samples obtained from asymptomatic individuals and clinical malaria datasets collected from 2013 to 2016. Mapping, spatial clustering of infections and risk analysis were performed using georeferenced households.High incidences of clinical malaria episodes were observed to occur predominantly in households of asymptomatic P. falciparum carriers. A statistically significant association was found between asymptomatic carriage in a household and subsequent episode of clinical malaria occurring in that household for each individual year (p-values were 0.0017, 6x10 -5, 0.005, and 0.008 for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 respectively) and the combined years (p=8.5x10 -8), which was not found at the individual level. In both villages, no significant patterns of spatial clustering of P. falciparum clinical cases was found, but there was a higher risk of clinical episodes \&lt;25m from asymptomatic individuals in Ndiop attributable to clustering within households.The findings provide strong epidemiological evidence linking the asymptomatic P. falciparum reservoir to clinical malaria episodes at household scale in Dielmo and Ndiop villagers. This argues for a likely success of a mass testing and treatment intervention to move towards the elimination of malaria in Dielmo and Ndiop villages.},

  abstract = {Classification of time-series of vegetation indices (VIs) can be a reliable strategy for identifying and monitoring different crop types. Recently, with the advent of new sensors, the time-series data with high spatial and temporal resolutions have become widely available and used for constructing various VIs time-series. These high-resolution time-series, in addition to temporal information about the crops’ phenology, contain valuable information about the spatial patterns of croplands. This information can be used to increase the performance of crop classification. In order to properly extract both spatial and temporal information from the time-series of VIs, we proposed the concept of histogram-based spatio-temporal (HST) features. These features represent each pixel in a time-series by the histogram of its spatio-temporal neighborhood. The HST features, like any other histogram-based features, are characterized by high dimensionality and sparseness. Consequently, the common classification algorithms cannot be employed for their classification. To address this issue, we presented Support Vector Machines (SVM) using an intersection kernel, which is specifically proposed for classification of histogram-based features. Time-series of three different vegetation indices, namely, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIRE) were considered to evaluate the performance of the HST features. The results of experimental tests showed that the HST features by yielding the overall accuracy of 88.31\%, 87.27\% and 84.36\% for NDVIRE, NDVI, and SAVI respectively are much more informative than other textural features used for comparison. Moreover, we provided a detailed analysis of the performance of the HST features concerning the size of the spatio-temporal neighborhood and the number of histogram’s bins.},

Both flood event and non-flood (permanent water) sites were selected and evaluated. The criteria for flood event site selection was straightforward: incorporate 1) as many areas spread across the globe as possible, paying attention to varying latitudes, 2) different times of the year, 3) areas of high (i.e. central Africa) and low percentage cloud cover (i.e. Australia), 4) areas in which NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s Office of Applied Sciences has active projects (i.e. Caribbean, southern Africa, North Africa), and 5) flooded areas that coincide with various land cover, represented by the NASA MODIS 500m IGBP Land Cover Type product, in order to determine if there is a relationship between product performance and land cover type. These criteria were honored whenever possible but obvious limitations exist as our site selection for flood mapping was ultimately dictated by where flood events occurred in 2013 and 2014. NRT mapping products from these most recent years were used in order to evaluate the latest iteration of the NRT product, with sites selected based on the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) flood listing (http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Archives/ Master Listrev.htm). The evaluation focuses on the 3-day product (3D3OT; v4.9), with a few 2-day (2D2OT; v4.1) and 14- day (14x3D3OT; v4.9) product examples. Brief introductions to the NASA MODIS NRT Global Flood Mapping system and products are provided below.

  abstract = {Malaria infections containing multiple parasite genotypes are ubiquitous in nature, and play a central role in models of recombination, intra-host dynamics, virulence, sex ratio, immunity and drug resistance evolution in Plasmodium. While these multiple infections (MIs) are often assumed to result from superinfection (bites from multiple infected mosquitoes), we know remarkably little about their composition or generation. We isolated 336 parasite clones from eight patients from Malawi (high transmission) and six from Thailand (low transmission) by dilution cloning. These were genotyped using 384 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, revealing 22 independent haplotypes in Malawi (2-6 per MI) and 15 in Thailand (2-5 per MI). Surprisingly, all six patients from Thailand and six of eight from Malawi contained related haplotypes, and haplotypes were more similar within- than between-infections. These results argue against a simple superinfection model. Instead, the observed kinship patterns may be explained by inoculation of multiple related haploid sporozoites from single mosquito bites, by immune suppression of parasite subpopulations within infections, and serial transmission of related parasites between people. That relatedness is maintained in endemic areas in the face of repeated bites from infected mosquitoes has profound implications for understanding malaria transmission, immunity and intra-host dynamics of co-infecting parasite genotypes.},

This project was designed to test this prediction. We generated 485 single-cell genome sequences from fifteen P.~falciparum malaria patients from Chikhwawa, Malawi-an area of intense transmission. Patients harbored up to seventeen unique parasite lineages. Surprisingly, parasite lineages within infections tend to be closely related, suggesting that superinfection by repeated mosquito bites is~rarer than co-transmission of parasites from a single mosquito. Both closely and distantly related parasites comprise an infection, suggesting sequential transmission of complex infections between multiple hosts. We identified tetrads and reconstructed parental haplotypes, which revealed the inbred ancestry of infections and non-Mendelian inheritance. Our analysis suggests strong barriers to secondary infection and outbreeding amongst malaria parasites from a high transmission setting, providing unexpected insights into the biology and transmission of malaria.},

  abstract = {Pathogen control programs provide a valuable, but rarely exploited, opportunity to directly examine the relationship between population decline and population genetics. We investigated the impact of an \textasciitilde 12-fold decline in transmission on the population genetics of Plasmodium falciparum infections (n = 1731) sampled from four clinics on the Thai-Burma border over 10 years and genotyped using 96 genome-wide SNPs. The most striking associated genetic change was a reduction in the frequency of infections containing multiple parasite genotypes from 63\% in 2001 to 14\% in 2010 (P = 3 × 10(-15)). Two measures of the clonal composition of populations (genotypic richness and the β-parameter of the Pareto distribution) declined over time as more people were infected by parasites with identical multilocus genotypes, consistent with increased selfing and a reduction in the rate at which multilocus genotypes are broken apart by recombination. We predicted that the reduction in transmission, multiple clone carriage and outbreeding would be mirrored by an increased influence of genetic drift. However, geographical differentiation and expected heterozygosity remained stable across the sampling period. Furthermore, N(e) estimates derived from allele frequencies fluctuation between years remained high (582 to ∞) and showed no downward trend. These results demonstrate how genetic data can compliment epidemiological assessments of infectious disease control programs. The temporal changes in a single declining population parallel to those seen in comparisons of parasite genetics in regions of differing endemicity, strongly supporting the notion that reduced opportunity for outbreeding is the key driver of these patterns.},

Large-scale, robust surveillance mechanisms that measure rather than estimate the actual burden of malaria over time from large areas of the continent where such data are lacking need to be prioritized.

The HAND model normalizes topography according to the local relative heights found along the drainage network, and in this way, presents the topology of the relative soil gravitational potentials, or local draining potentials. The HAND model has been demonstrated to show a high correlation with the depth of the water table, providing an accurate spatial representation of soil water environments. Normalized draining potentials can be classified according to the relative vertical flowpath-distances to the nearest drainages, defining classes of soil water environments. These classes have been shown to be comparable and have verifiable and reproducible hydrological significance across the studied catchment and for surrounding ungauged catchments. The robust validation of this model over an area of 18,000 km(2) in the lower Rio Negro catchment has demonstrated its capacity to map expansive environments using only remotely acquired topography data as inputs. The classified HAND model has also preliminarily demonstrated robustness when applied to ungauged catchments elsewhere with contrasting geologies, geomorphologies and soil types. The HAND model and the derived soil water maps can help to advance physically based hydrological models and be applied to a host of disciplines that focus on soil moisture and ground water dynamics. As an original assessment of soil water in the landscape, the HAND model explores the synergy between digital topography data and terrain modeling, presenting an opportunity for solving many difficult problems in hydrology.

  abstract = {Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) provide critical information for a wide range of scientific, navigational and engineering activities. Submeter resolution, stereoscopic satellite imagery with high geometric and radiometric quality, and wide spatial coverage are becoming increasingly accessible for generating stereo-photogrammetric DEMs. However, low contrast and repeatedly-textured surfaces, such as snow and glacial ice at high latitudes, and mountainous terrains challenge existing stereo-photogrammetric DEM generation techniques, particularly without a-priori information such as existing seed DEMs or the manual setting of terrain-specific parameters. To utilize these data for fully-automatic DEM extraction at a large scale, we developed the Surface Extraction from TIN-based Search-space Minimization (SETSM) algorithm. SETSM is fully automatic (i.e. no search parameter settings are needed) and uses only the sensor model Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs). SETSM adopts a hierarchical, combined image- and object-space matching strategy utilizing weighted normalized cross-correlation with both original distorted and geometrically corrected images for overcoming ambiguities caused by foreshortening and occlusions. In addition, SETSM optimally minimizes search-spaces to extract optimal matches over problematic terrains by iteratively updating object surfaces within a Triangulated Irregular Network, and utilizes a geometric-constrained blunder and outlier detection in object space. We prove the ability of SETSM to mitigate typical stereo-photogrammetric matching problems over a range of challenging terrains. SETSM is the primary DEM generation software for the US National Science Foundation's ArcticDEM project.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To design an effective strategy for the control of malaria requires a map of infection and disease risks to select appropriate suites of interventions. Advances in model based geo-statistics and malaria parasite prevalence data assemblies provide unique opportunities to redefine national Plasmodium falciparum risk distributions. Here we present a new map of malaria risk for Kenya in 2009. METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate data were assembled from cross-sectional community based surveys undertaken from 1975 to 2009. Details recorded for each survey included the month and year of the survey, sample size, positivity and the age ranges of sampled population. Data were corrected to a standard age-range of two to less than 10 years (PfPR2-10) and each survey location was geo-positioned using national and on-line digital settlement maps. Ecological and climate covariates were matched to each PfPR2-10 survey location and examined separately and in combination for relationships to PfPR2-10. Significant covariates were then included in a Bayesian geostatistical spatial-temporal framework to predict continuous and categorical maps of mean PfPR2-10 at a 1 x 1 km resolution across Kenya for the year 2009. Model hold-out data were used to test the predictive accuracy of the mapped surfaces and distributions of the posterior uncertainty were mapped. RESULTS: A total of 2,682 estimates of PfPR2-10 from surveys undertaken at 2,095 sites between 1975 and 2009 were selected for inclusion in the geo-statistical modeling. The covariates selected for prediction were urbanization; maximum temperature; precipitation; enhanced vegetation index; and distance to main water bodies. The final Bayesian geo-statistical model had a high predictive accuracy with mean error of -0.15\% PfPR2-10; mean absolute error of 0.38\% PfPR2-10; and linear correlation between observed and predicted PfPR2-10 of 0.81. The majority of Kenya's 2009 population (35.2 million, 86.3\%) reside in areas where predicted PfPR2-10 is less than 5\%; conversely in 2009 only 4.3 million people (10.6\%) lived in areas where PfPR2-10 was predicted to be {$>$} or =40\% and were largely located around the shores of Lake Victoria. CONCLUSION: Model based geo-statistical methods can be used to interpolate malaria risks in Kenya with precision and our model shows that the majority of Kenyans live in areas of very low P. falciparum risk. As malaria interventions go to scale effectively tracking epidemiological changes of risk demands a rigorous effort to document infection prevalence in time and space to remodel risks and redefine intervention priorities over the next 10-15 years.},

  abstract = {The Asia-Pacific region faces formidable challenges in achieving malaria elimination by the proposed target in 2030. Molecular surveillance of Plasmodium parasites can provide important information on malaria transmission and adaptation, which can inform national malaria control programmes (NMCPs) in decision-making processes. In November 2019 a parasite genotyping workshop was held in Jakarta, Indonesia, to review molecular approaches for parasite surveillance and explore ways in which these tools can be integrated into public health systems and inform policy. The meeting was attended by 70 participants from 8 malaria-endemic countries and partners of the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network. The participants acknowledged the utility of multiple use cases for parasite genotyping including: quantifying the prevalence of drug resistant parasites, predicting risks of treatment failure, identifying major routes and reservoirs of infection, monitoring imported malaria and its contribution to local transmission, characterizing the origins and dynamics of malaria outbreaks, and estimating the frequency of Plasmodium vivax relapses. However, the priority of each use case varies with different endemic settings. Although a one-size-fits-all approach to molecular surveillance is unlikely to be applicable across the Asia-Pacific region, consensus on the spectrum of added-value activities will help support data sharing across national boundaries. Knowledge exchange is needed to establish local expertise in different laboratory-based methodologies and bioinformatics processes. Collaborative research involving local and international teams will help maximize the impact of analytical outputs on the operational needs of NMCPs. Research is also needed to explore the cost-effectiveness of genetic epidemiology for different use cases to help to leverage funding for wide-scale implementation. Engagement between NMCPs and local researchers will be critical throughout this process.},

All aerobic organisms have evolved the ability to regulate the levels of these toxic intermediates, whereas some have evolved elaborate signalling pathways to dramatically increase the levels of ROS and use them as weapons in mounting a defence response, a process commonly referred to as the oxidative burst. The balance between steady state levels of ROS and the exponential increase in these levels during the oxidative burst has begun to shed light on complex signalling networks mediated by these molecules. Here, we discuss the different sources of ROS that are present in plant cells and review their role in the oxidative burst. We further describe two well-studied ROS generating systems, the NADPH oxidase and apoplastic peroxidase proteins, and their role as the primary producers of ROS during pathogen invasion. We then discuss what is known about the metabolic and proteomic fluxes that occur in plant cells during the oxidative burst and after pathogen recognition, and try to highlight underlying biochemical processes that may provide more insight on the complex regulation of ROS in plants.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gold standard for diagnosing Plasmodium falciparum infection is microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears. The effectiveness of this procedure for infection surveillance and malaria control may be limited by a relatively high parasitaemia detection threshold. Persons with microscopically undetectable infections may go untreated, contributing to ongoing transmission to mosquito vectors. The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude and determinants of undiagnosed submicroscopic P. falciparum infections in a rural area of western Kenya. METHODS: A health facility-based survey was conducted, and 367 patients seeking treatment for symptoms consistent with uncomplicated malaria in Homa Bay County were enrolled. The frequency of submicroscopic P. falciparum infection was measured by comparing the prevalence of infection based on light microscopic inspection of thick blood smears versus real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting P. falciparum 18S rRNA gene. Long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) use, participation in nocturnal outdoor activities, and gender were considered as potential determinants of submicroscopic infections. RESULTS: Microscopic inspection of blood smears was positive for asexual P. falciparum parasites in 14.7\% (54/367) of cases. All of these samples were confirmed by RT-PCR. 35.8\% (112/313) of blood smear negative cases were positive by RT-PCR, i.e., submicroscopic infection, resulting in an overall prevalence by RT-PCR alone of 45.2\% compared to 14.7\% for blood smear alone. Females had a higher prevalence of submicroscopic infections (35.6\% or 72 out of 202 individuals, 95\% CI 28.9-42.3) compared to males (24.2\%, 40 of 165 individuals, 95\% CI 17.6-30.8). The risk of submicroscopic infections in LLIN users was about half that of non-LLIN users (OR\,=\,0.59). There was no difference in the prevalence of submicroscopic infections of study participants who were active in nocturnal outdoor activities versus those who were not active (OR\,=\,0.91). Patients who participated in nocturnal outdoor activities and use LLINs while indoors had a slightly higher risk of submicroscopic infection than those who did not use LLINs (OR\,=\,1.48). CONCLUSION: Microscopic inspection of blood smears from persons with malaria symptoms for asexual stage P. falciparum should be supplemented by more sensitive diagnostic tests in order to reduce ongoing transmission of P. falciparum parasites to local mosquito vectors.},

Here, we compared the performance of a target-capture approach using alternative sources of genomic DNA from 10 specimens of spring salamanders (Plethodontidae: Gyrinophilus porphyriticus) collected between 1985 and 1990: allozyme supernatants, allozyme homogenate pellets and formalin-fixed tissues. We designed capture probes based on double-digest restriction-site associated sequencing (RADseq) derived loci from frozen blood samples available for seven of the specimens and assessed the success and consistency of capture and RADseq approaches. This study design enabled direct comparisons of data quality and potential biases among the different data sets for phylogenomic and population genomic analyses. We found that in phylogenetic analyses, all enrichment types for a given specimen clustered together. In principal component space all capture-based samples clustered together, but RADseq samples did not cluster with corresponding capture-based samples. Single nucleotide polymorphism calls were on average 18.3\% different between enrichment types for a given individual, but these discrepancies were primarily due to differences in heterozygous/homozygous single nucleotide polymorphism calls. We demonstrate that both allozyme supernatant and formalin-fixed samples can be successfully used for population genomic analyses and we discuss ways to identify and reduce biases associated with combining capture and RADseq data.},

Here I review possible effects of climate change on vector-borne diseases, methods used to predict these effects and the evidence to date of changes in vector-borne disease risks that can be attributed to recent climate change. Predictions have both over- and underestimated the effects of climate change. Mostly under-estimations of effects are due to a focus only on direct effects of climate on disease ecology while more distal effects on society's capacity to control and prevent vector-borne disease are ignored. There is increasing evidence for possible impacts of recent climate change on some vector-borne diseases but for the most part, observed data series are too short (or non-existent), and impacts of climate-independent factors too great, to confidently attribute changing risk to climate change.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most malaria vectors belong to species complexes. Sibling species often exhibit divergent behaviors dictating the measures that can be deployed effectively in their control. Despite the importance of the Anopheles funestus complex in malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, sibling species have rarely been identified in the past and their vectoring potential remains understudied. METHODS: We analyzed 1149 wild-caught An. funestus (senso lato) specimens from 21 sites in Kenya, covering the major malaria endemic areas including western, central and coastal areas. Indoor and outdoor collection tools were used targeting host-seeking and resting mosquitoes. The identity of sibling species, infection with malaria Plasmodium parasites, and the host blood meal sources of engorged specimens were analyzed using PCR-based and sequencing methods. RESULTS: The most abundant sibling species collected in all study sites were Anopheles funestus (59.8\%) and Anopheles rivulorum (32.4\%) among the 1062 successfully amplified specimens of the An. funestus complex. Proportionally, An. funestus dominated in indoor collections whilst An. rivulorum dominated in outdoor collections. Other species identified were Anopheles leesoni (4.6\%), Anopheles parensis (2.4\%), Anopheles vaneedeni (0.1\%) and for the first time in Kenya, Anopheles longipalpis C (0.7\%). Anopheles funestus had an overall Plasmodium infection rate of 9.7\% (62/636), predominantly Plasmodium falciparum (59), with two infected with Plasmodium ovale and one with Plasmodium malariae. There was no difference in the infection rate between indoor and outdoor collections. Out of 344 An. rivulorum, only one carried P. falciparum. We also detected P. falciparum infection in two non-blood-fed An. longipalpis C (2/7) which is the first record for this species in Kenya. The mean human blood indices for An. funestus and An. rivulorum were 68\% (93/136) and 64\% (45/70), respectively, with feeding tendencies on a broad host range including humans and domestic animals such as cow, goat, sheep, chicken and pig. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the importance of active surveillance through application of molecular approaches to unravel novel parasite-vector associations possibly contributed by cryptic species with important implications for effective malaria control and elimination.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anopheles funestus is among the major malaria vectors in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa and has been recently implicated in persistent malaria transmission. However, its ecology and genetic diversity remain poorly understood in Kenya. METHODS: Using 16 microsatellite loci, we examined the genetic structure of An. funestus sampled from 11 locations (n = 426 individuals) across a wide geographical range in Kenya spanning coastal, western and Rift Valley areas. RESULTS: Kenyan An. funestus resolved as three genetically distinct clusters. The largest cluster (FUN1) broadly included samples from western and Rift Valley areas of Kenya with two clusters identified from coastal Kenya (FUN2 and FUN3), not previously reported. Geographical distance had no effect on population differentiation of An. funestus. We found a significant variation in the mean Plasmodium infectivity between the clusters (χ2 = 12.1, df = 2, P = 0.002) and proportional to the malaria prevalence in the different risk zones of Kenya. Notably, there was variation in estimated effective population sizes between the clusters, suggesting possible differential impact of anti-vector interventions in represented areas. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity among Kenyan populations of An. funestus will impact malaria vector control with practical implications for the development of gene-drive technologies. The difference in Plasmodium infectivity and effective population size between the clusters could suggest potential variation in phenotypic characteristics relating to competence or insecticide resistance. This is worth examining in future studies.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical need for accurate epidemic forecasting to predict pathogen spread and evolution, anticipate healthcare challenges, and evaluate intervention strategies. The reliability of these forecasts hinges on detailed knowledge of disease transmission across different population segments, which may be inferred from within-community transmission rates via proxy data, such as contact surveys and mobility data. However, these approaches are indirect, making it difficult to accurately estimate rare transmissions between socially or geographically distant communities. We show that the steep ramp up of genome sequencing surveillance during the pandemic can be leveraged to directly identify transmission patterns between communities. Specifically, our approach uses a hidden Markov model to infer the fraction of infections a community imports from other communities based on how rapidly the allele frequencies in the focal community converge to those in the donor communities. Applying this method to SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data from England and the U.S., we uncover networks of inter-community disease transmission that, while broadly reflecting geographical relationships, also expose epidemiologically significant long-range interactions. We provide evidence that transmission between regions can substantially change between waves of variants of concern, both in magnitude and direction, and analyze how the inferred plasticity and heterogeneity in inter-community transmission impact evolutionary forecasts. Overall, our study high-lights population genomic time series data as a crucial record of epidemiological interactions, which can be deciphered using tree-free inference methods.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A detailed knowledge of the distribution of the main Anopheles malaria vectors in Kenya should guide national vector control strategies. However, contemporary spatial distributions of the locally dominant Anopheles vectors including Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles merus, Anopheles funestus, Anopheles pharoensis and Anopheles nili are lacking. The methods and approaches used to assemble contemporary available data on the present distribution of the dominant malaria vectors in Kenya are presented here. METHOD: Primary empirical data from published and unpublished sources were identified for the period 1990 to 2009. Details recorded for each source included the first author, year of publication, report type, survey location name, month and year of survey, the main Anopheles species reported as present and the sampling and identification methods used. Survey locations were geo-positioned using national digital place name archives and on-line geo-referencing resources. The geo-located species-presence data were displayed and described administratively, using first-level administrative units (province), and biologically, based on the predicted spatial margins of Plasmodium falciparum transmission intensity in Kenya for the year 2009. Each geo-located survey site was assigned an urban or rural classification and attributed an altitude value. RESULTS: A total of 498 spatially unique descriptions of Anopheles vector species across Kenya sampled between 1990 and 2009 were identified, 53\% were obtained from published sources and further communications with authors. More than half (54\%) of the sites surveyed were investigated since 2005. A total of 174 sites reported the presence of An. gambiae complex without identification of sibling species. Anopheles arabiensis and An. funestus were the most widely reported at 244 and 265 spatially unique sites respectively with the former showing the most ubiquitous distribution nationally. Anopheles gambiae, An. arabiensis, An. funestus and An. pharoensis were reported at sites located in all the transmission intensity classes with more reports of An. gambiae in the highest transmission intensity areas than the very low transmission areas. CONCLUSION: A contemporary, spatially defined database of the main malaria vectors in Kenya provides a baseline for future compilations of data and helps identify areas where information is currently lacking. The data collated here are published alongside this paper where it may help guide future sampling location decisions, help with the planning of vector control suites nationally and encourage broader research inquiry into vector species niche modeling.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reports of declining incidence of malaria disease burden across several countries in Africa suggest that the epidemiology of malaria across the continent is in transition. Whether this transition is directly related to the scaling of intervention coverage remains a moot point. METHODS: Paediatric admission data from eight Kenyan hospitals and their catchments have been assembled across two three-year time periods: September 2003 to August 2006 (pre-scaled intervention) and September 2006 to August 2009 (post-scaled intervention). Interrupted time series (ITS) models were developed adjusting for variations in rainfall and hospital use by surrounding communities to show changes in malaria hospitalization over the two periods. The temporal changes in factors that might explain changes in disease incidence were examined sequentially for each hospital setting, compared between hospital settings and ranked according to plausible explanatory factors. RESULTS: In six out of eight sites there was a decline in Malaria admission rates with declines between 18\% and 69\%. At two sites malaria admissions rates increased by 55\% and 35\%. Results from the ITS models indicate that before scaled intervention in September 2006, there was a significant month-to-month decline in the mean malaria admission rates at four hospitals (trend P {$<$} 0.05). At the point of scaled intervention, the estimated mean admission rates for malaria was significantly less at four sites compared to the pre-scaled period baseline. Following scaled intervention there was a significant change in the month-to-month trend in the mean malaria admission rates in some but not all of the sites. Plausibility assessment of possible drivers of change pre- versus post-scaled intervention showed inconsistent patterns however, allowing for the increase in rainfall in the second period, there is a suggestion that starting transmission intensity and the scale of change in ITN coverage might explain some but not all of the variation in effect size. At most sites where declines between observation periods were documented admission rates were changing before free mass ITN distribution and prior to the implementation of ACT across Kenya. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of significant within and between location heterogeneity in temporal trends of malaria disease burden. Plausible drivers for changing disease incidence suggest a complex combination of mechanisms, not easily measured retrospectively.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Under trial conditions insecticide-treated nets have been shown to provide significant clinical and mortality protection under a range of malaria transmission intensity conditions. There are, however, few operational impact data, notably in very intense transmission conditions. This study, reports on malaria infection among Kenyan schoolchildren living in areas of intense malaria transmission and their reported use of insecticide-treated bed nets. METHODS: 5188 children in 54 schools were randomly sampled from seven counties surrounding Lake Victoria between May and June 2014. A questionnaire was administered to schoolchildren in classes 2-6 on the use of a long-lasting, insecticide-treated net (LLIN) the night before the survey and provided a single blood sample for a rapid diagnostic test for malaria infection. Analysis of the impact of insecticide-treated net use on malaria prevalence was undertaken using a multivariable, mixed effects, logistic regression at 95\% confidence interval (CI), taking into account hierarchical nature of the data and results adjusted for school clusters. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of malaria infection was 48.7\%, two-thirds (67.9\%) of the children reported using LLIN, 91.3\% of the children reported that their households own at least one LLIN and the household LLIN coverage was 2.5 persons per one LLIN. The prevalence of infection showed variation across the counties, with prevalence being highest in Busia (66.9\%) and Homabay (51.8\%) counties, and lowest in Migori County (29.6\%). Generally, malaria parasite prevalence differed between age groups and gender with the highest prevalence occurring in children below 7 years (50.6\%) and males (52.2\%). Adjusting for county and school, there was a significant reduction in odds of malaria infection among the schoolchildren who reported LLIN use the previous night by 14 \% (aOR 0.86, 95\% CI 0.74-0.98, P {$<$} 0.027). CONCLUSION: Malaria transmission continues to be high around Lake Victoria. Despite evidence of increasing pyrethroid resistance and the likely overall efficacy of LLIN distributed several years prior to the survey, LLIN continue to provide protection against infection among school-aged children.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: As malaria transmission declines, understanding the differential impact of intensified control on Plasmodium falciparum relative to Plasmodium vivax and identifying key drivers of ongoing transmission is essential to guide future interventions. METHODS: Three longitudinal child cohorts were conducted in Papua New Guinea before (2006/2007), during (2008) and after scale-up of control interventions (2013). In each cohort, children aged 1-5\,years were actively monitored for infection and illness. Incidence of malaria episodes, molecular force of blood-stage infections (molFOB) and population-averaged prevalence of infections were compared across the cohorts to investigate the impact of intensified control in young children and the key risk factors for malaria infection and illness in 2013. RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2008, P. falciparum infection prevalence, molFOB, and clinical malaria episodes reduced by 47\%, 59\% and 69\%, respectively, and a further 49\%, 29\% and 75\% from 2008 to 2013 (prevalence 41.6\% to 22.1\% to 11.2\%; molFOB: 3.4 to 1.4 to 1.0 clones/child/year; clinical episodes incidence rate (IR) 2.6 to 0.8 to IR 0.2 episodes/child/year). P. vivax clinical episodes declined at rates comparable to P. falciparum between 2006, 2008 and 2013 (IR 2.5 to 1.1 to 0.2), while P. vivax molFOB (2006, 9.8; 2008, 12.1) and prevalence (2006, 59.6\%; 2008, 65.0\%) remained high in 2008. However, in 2013, P. vivax molFOB (1.2) and prevalence (19.7\%) had also substantially declined. In 2013, 89\% of P. falciparum and 93\% of P. vivax infections were asymptomatic, 62\% and 47\%, respectively, were sub-microscopic. Area of residence was the major determinant of malaria infection and illness. CONCLUSION: Intensified vector control and routine case management had a differential impact on rates of P. falciparum and P. vivax infections but not clinical malaria episodes in young children. This suggests comparable reductions in new mosquito-derived infections but a delayed impact on P. vivax relapsing infections due to a previously acquired reservoir of hypnozoites. This demonstrates the need to strengthen implementation of P. vivax radical cure to maximise impact of control in co-endemic areas. The high heterogeneity of malaria in 2013 highlights the importance of surveillance and targeted interventions to accelerate towards elimination.},

  abstract = {Background.~Malaria control, and finally malaria elimination, requires the identification and targeting of residual foci or hotspots of transmission. However, the level of parasite mixing within and between geographical locations is likely to impact the effectiveness and durability of control interventions and thus should be taken into consideration when developing control programs. Methods.~In order to determine the geographic-genetic patterns of Plasmodium falciparum parasite populations at a sub-national level in Kenya, we used the Sequenom platform to genotype 111 genome-wide distributed single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) positions in 2486 isolates collected from children in 95 primary schools in western Kenya. We analysed these parasite genotypes for genetic structure using principal component analysis and assessed local and global clustering using statistical measures of spatial autocorrelation. We further examined the region for spatial barriers to parasite movement as well as directionality in the patterns of parasite movement. Results.~We found no evidence of population structure and little evidence of spatial autocorrelation of parasite genotypes (correlation coefficients {$<$}0.03 among parasite pairs in distance classes of 1km, 2km and 5km; p value{$<$}0.01). An analysis of the geographical distribution of allele frequencies showed weak evidence of variation in distribution of alleles, with clusters representing a higher than expected number of samples with the major allele being identified for 5 SNPs. Furthermore, we found no evidence of the existence of spatial barriers to parasite movement within the region, but observed directional movement of parasites among schools in two separate sections of the region studied. Conclusions. Our findings illustrate a pattern of high parasite mixing within the study region. If this mixing is due to rapid gene flow, then "one-off" targeted interventions may not be currently effective at the sub-national scale in Western Kenya, due to the high parasite movement that is likely to lead to re-introduction of infection from surrounding regions. However repeated targeted interventions may reduce transmission in the surrounding regions.},

However, there are few empiric estimates of parasite mixing with which to parametize such models.              Methods Here we genotype 276 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5199 P. falciparum isolates from two Kenyan sites and one Gambian site to determine the spatio-temporal extent of parasite mixing, and use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear regression to examine the relationship between genetic relatedness and relatedness in space and time for parasite pairs.              Results We show that there are no discrete geographically restricted parasite sub-populations, but instead we see a diffuse spatio-temporal structure to parasite genotypes.~ Genetic relatedness of sample pairs is predicted by relatedness in space and time.

Crop coverage identification is a very important technique, as it provides vital information on the type and extent of crop cultivated in a particular area. This information has immense potential in the planning for further cultivation activities and for optimal usage of the available fertile land. As the frontiers of space technology advance, the knowledge derived from the satellite data has also grown in sophistication. Further, image classification forms the core of the solution to the crop coverage identification problem. No single classifier can prove to satisfactorily classify all the basic crop cover mapping problems of a cultivated region. We present in this paper the experimental results of multiple classification techniques for the problem of crop cover mapping of a cultivated region. A detailed comparison of the algorithms inspired by social behaviour of insects and conventional statistical method for crop classification is presented in this paper. These include the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) techniques. The high resolution satellite image has been used for the experiments.},

The spatio-temporal distribution of larval habitats of malaria vectors determines the distribution of adult vectors, hence, disease transmission. Vector's ecology is necessary for strategic vector control through effective plan for source reduction. Mapping of the larval habitats is necessary for targeted control measures. The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the spatial and seasonal variations in anopheline larval habitats in Western Kenya. METHODS: A comparative study was conducted on spatial distribution of GPS geo-located anopheline larval habitats in relation to highland and lowland environments. Land use types were categorized and all potential aquatic habitats of malaria vectors were examined in February, May, August and November 2004. Data analyses were performed using SAS JMP software. RESULTS \& DISCUSSION: Results showed a higher percentage of Anopheles gambiae s.s. (70.9\%) than An. funestus (29.1\%) in highland. In the lowland, An. gambiae s.l. comprised 60.1\% while An. funestus represented 39.9\%. The distribution of larval breeding is confined to the valley bottom in the highland while it was dispersed in the lowland. Land use type influenced the occurrence of positive breeding habitats in the highland. In the lowland, distribution was due to seasonality. We found high proportion of potential and positive breeding sites in cultivated swamps and farmlands at the highland site. These results suggest that swamp cultivation increases the availability and suitability of larval breeding habitats of malaria vectors, thus malaria transmission in the Western Kenya highlands environment.},

Plasmodium falciparum surface protein Pfs47 is critical in the parasite's survival by manipulating the vector's immune system hence a promising target for blocking transmission in the mosquito. This study aimed to examine the genetic diversity, haplotype distribution, and population structure of Pfs47 and its implications on malaria infections in endemic lowlands in Western Kenya. Cross-sectional mass blood screening was conducted in malaria endemic regions in the lowlands of Western Kenya: Homa Bay, Kombewa, and Chulaimbo. Dried blood spots and slide smears were simultaneously collected in 2018 and 2019. DNA was extracted using Chelex method from microscopic Plasmodium falciparum positive samples and used to genotype Pfs47 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Thirteen observed haplotypes of the Pfs47 gene were circulating in Western Kenya. Population-wise, haplotype diversity ranged from 0.69 to 0.77 and the nucleotide diversity 0.10 to 0.12 across all sites. All the study sites displayed negative Tajima's D values although not significant. However, the negative and significant Fu's Fs statistical values were observed across all the study sites, suggesting population expansion or positive selection. Overall genetic differentiation index was not significant (FST = -0.00891, P {$>$} 0.05) among parasite populations. All Nm values revealed a considerable gene flow in these populations. These results could have important implications for the persistence of high levels of malaria transmission and should be considered when designing potential targeted control interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evolutionary pressures lead to the selection of efficient malaria vectors either resistant or susceptible to Plasmodium parasites. These forces may favour the introduction of species genotypes that adapt to new breeding habitats, potentially having an impact on malaria transmission. Thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) of Anopheles gambiae complex plays an important role in innate immune defenses against parasites. This study aims to characterize the distribution pattern of TEP1 polymorphisms among populations of An. gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) in western Kenya. METHODS: Anopheles gambiae adult and larvae were collected using pyrethrum spray catches (PSC) and plastic dippers respectively from Homa Bay, Kakamega, Bungoma, and Kisumu counties between 2017 and 2020. Collected adults and larvae reared to the adult stage were morphologically identified and then identified to sibling species by PCR. TEP1 alleles were determined in 627 anopheles mosquitoes using restriction fragment length polymorphisms-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) and to validate the TEP1 genotyping results, a representative sample of the alleles was sequenced. RESULTS: Two TEP1 alleles (TEP1*S1 and TEP1*R2) and three corresponding genotypes (*S1/S1, *R2/S1, and *R2/R2) were identified. TEP1*S1 and TEP1*R2 with their corresponding genotypes, homozygous *S1/S1 and heterozygous *R2/S1 were widely distributed across all sites with allele frequencies of approximately 80\% and 20\%, respectively both in Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis. There was no significant difference detected among the populations and between the two mosquito species in TEP1 allele frequency and genotype frequency. The overall low levels in population structure (FST\,=\,0.019) across all sites corresponded to an effective migration index (Nm\,=\,12.571) and low Nei's genetic distance values ({$<$}\,0.500) among the subpopulation. The comparative fixation index values revealed minimal genetic differentiation between species and high levels of gene flow among populations. CONCLUSION: Genotyping TEP1 has identified two common TEP1 alleles (TEP1*S1 and TEP1*R2) and three corresponding genotypes (*S1/S1, *R2/S1, and *R2/R2) in An. gambiae s.l. The TEP1 allele genetic diversity and population structure are low in western Kenya.},

Lake region isolates are placed within the context of African-wide populations using Illumina WGS data and population genomic analyses. Our analysis revealed that P. falciparum isolates from Lake Victoria form a cluster within the East African parasite population. These isolates also appear to have distinct ancestral origins, containing genome-wide signatures from both Central and East African lineages. Known drug resistance biomarkers were observed at similar frequencies to those of East African parasite populations, including the S160N/T mutation in the pfap2mu gene, which has been associated with delayed clearance by artemisinin-based combination therapy. Overall, our work provides a first assessment of P. falciparum genetic diversity within the Lake Victoria basin, a region targeting malaria elimination.},

Despite recent increases in malaria incidence, high-resolution genome-wide analyses of Plasmodium parasite populations are sparse in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The Kenyan-Ugandan border region is a particular concern, with Uganda confirming the emergence and spread of artemisinin resistant P. falciparum parasites. To establish genomic surveillance along the Kenyan-Ugandan border and analyse P. falciparum population dynamics within East Africa, we generated whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for 38 parasites from Bungoma, Western Kenya. These sequences were integrated into a genomic analysis of available East African isolate data (n\,=\,599) and revealed parasite subpopulations with distinct genetic structure and diverse ancestral origins. Ancestral admixture analysis of these subpopulations alongside isolates from across Africa (n\,=\,365) suggested potential independent ancestral populations from other major African populations. Within isolates from Western Kenya, the prevalence of biomarkers associated with chloroquine resistance (e.g. Pfcrt K76T) were significantly reduced compared to wider East African populations and a single isolate contained the PfK13 V568I variant, potentially linked to reduced susceptibility to artemisinin.

Commensal bacteria in the midgut can reduce the ability of mosquitoes to transmit disease, either by having direct anti-parasite effects or by stimulating basal immune responses of the insect host. As different bacteria have different effects on parasite development, the composition of the bacterial community in the mosquito gut is likely to affect the probability of disease transmission. We investigated the diversity of mosquito gut bacteria in the field using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA to build up a comprehensive picture of the diversity of gut bacteria in eight mosquito species in this population. We found that mosquito gut typically has a very simple gut microbiota that is dominated by a single bacterial taxon. Although different mosquito species share remarkably similar gut bacteria, individuals in a population are extremely variable and can have little overlap in the bacterial taxa present in their guts. This may be an important factor in causing differences in disease transmission rates within mosquito populations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Persons with submicroscopic malaria infection are a major reservoir of gametocytes that sustain malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite recent decreases in the national malaria burden in Kenya due to vector control interventions, malaria transmission continues to be high in western regions of the country bordering Lake Victoria. The objective of this study was to advance knowledge of the topographical, demographic and behavioral risk factors associated with submicroscopic malaria infection in the Lake Victoria basin in Kisumu County. METHODS: Cross-sectional community surveys for malaria infection were undertaken in three eco-epidemiologically distinct zones in Nyakach sub-County, Kisumu. Adjacent regions were topologically characterized as lakeshore, hillside and highland plateau. Surveys were conducted during the 2019 and 2020 wet and dry seasons. Finger prick blood smears and dry blood spots (DBS) on filter paper were collected from 1,777 healthy volunteers for microscopic inspection and real time-PCR (RT-PCR) diagnosis of Plasmodium infection. Persons who were PCR positive but blood smear negative were considered to harbor submicroscopic infections. Topographical, demographic and behavioral risk factors were correlated with community prevalence of submicroscopic infections. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1,777 blood samples collected, 14.2\% (253/1,777) were diagnosed as submicroscopic infections. Blood smear microscopy and RT-PCR, respectively, detected 3.7\% (66/1,777) and 18\% (319/1,777) infections. Blood smears results were exclusively positive for P. falciparum, whereas RT-PCR also detected P. malariae and P. ovale mono- and co-infections. Submicroscopic infection prevalence was associated with topographical variation (χ2 = 39.344, df = 2, p{$<$}0.0001). The highest prevalence was observed in the lakeshore zone (20.6\%, n = 622) followed by the hillside (13.6\%, n = 595) and highland plateau zones (7.9\%, n = 560). Infection prevalence varied significantly according to season (χ2 = 17.374, df = 3, p{$<$}0.0001). The highest prevalence was observed in residents of the lakeshore zone in the 2019 dry season (29.9\%, n = 167) and 2020 and 2019 rainy seasons (21.5\%, n = 144 and 18.1\%, n = 155, respectively). In both the rainy and dry seasons the likelihood of submicroscopic infection was higher in the lakeshore (AOR: 2.71, 95\% CI = 1.85-3.95; p{$<$}0.0001) and hillside (AOR: 1.74, 95\% CI = 1.17-2.61, p = 0.007) than in the highland plateau zones. Residence in the lakeshore zone (p{$<$}0.0001), male sex (p = 0.025), school age (p = 0.002), and living in mud houses (p = 0.044) increased the risk of submicroscopic malaria infection. Bed net use (p = 0.112) and occupation (p = 0.116) were not associated with submicroscopic infection prevalence. CONCLUSION: Topographic features of the local landscape and seasonality are major correlates of submicroscopic malaria infection in the Lake Victoria area of western Kenya.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic diversity studies provide evidence of Plasmodium falciparum differentiation that could affect fitness and adaptation to drugs and target antigens for vaccine development. This study describes the genetic structure of P. falciparum populations in urban and rural sites from southwestern Nigeria. METHODOLOGY: Ten neutral microsatellite loci were genotyped in 196 P. falciparum infections from three localities: Aramoko-Ekiti, a rural community; Lekki, an urban location and Badagry, a peri-urban border settlement. Analysis was performed on the genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium, population structure and inter-population differentiation. RESULTS: Allelic diversity values were similar across all populations, with mean expected heterozygosity (HE) values between 0.65 and 0.79. No matching multilocus haplotypes were found and analysis of multilocus LD showed no significant index of association. Genetic differentiation between populations was low (ΦPT\,=\,0.017). CONCLUSION: The absence of detectable population structure of P. falciparum in southwestern Nigeria is evident in the lack of significant differentiation between populations separated by about 200 km. This implies that a fairly uniform malaria control strategy may be effective over a wide geographic range in this highly endemic region. However, more wide-scale survey across the country will be required to inform malaria control in this large and densely populated endemic region.},

  abstract = {An important research gap in landscape genetics is the impact of different field sampling designs on the ability to detect the effects of landscape pattern on gene flow. We evaluated how five different sampling regimes (random, linear, systematic, cluster, and single study site) affected the probability of correctly identifying the generating landscape process of population structure. Sampling regimes were chosen to represent a suite of designs common in field studies. We used genetic data generated from a spatially-explicit, individual-based program and simulated gene flow in a continuous population across a landscape with gradual spatial changes in resistance to movement. Additionally, we evaluated the sampling regimes using realistic and obtainable number of loci (10 and 20), number of alleles per locus (5 and 10), number of individuals sampled (10–300), and generational time after the landscape was introduced (20 and 400). For a simulated continuously distributed species, we found that random, linear, and systematic sampling regimes performed well with high sample sizes ({$>$}200), levels of polymorphism (10 alleles per locus), and number of molecular markers (20). The cluster and single study site sampling regimes were not able to correctly identify the generating process under any conditions and thus, are not advisable strategies for scenarios similar to our simulations. Our research emphasizes the importance of sampling data at ecologically appropriate spatial and temporal scales and suggests careful consideration for sampling near landscape components that are likely to most influence the genetic structure of the species. In addition, simulating sampling designs a priori could help guide filed data collection efforts},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Translating genomic technologies into healthcare applications for the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has been limited by the technical and logistical difficulties of obtaining high quality clinical samples from the field. Sampling by dried blood spot (DBS) finger-pricks can be performed safely and efficiently with minimal resource and storage requirements compared with venous blood (VB). Here, the use of selective whole genome amplification (sWGA) to sequence the P. falciparum genome from clinical DBS samples was evaluated, and the results compared with current methods that use leucodepleted VB. METHODS: Parasite DNA with high ({$>$}95\%) human DNA contamination was selectively amplified by Phi29 polymerase using short oligonucleotide probes of 8-12~mers as primers. These primers were selected on the basis of their differential frequency of binding the desired (P. falciparum DNA) and contaminating (human) genomes. RESULTS: Using sWGA method, clinical samples from 156 malaria patients, including 120 paired samples for head-to-head comparison of DBS and leucodepleted VB were sequenced. Greater than 18-fold enrichment of P. falciparum DNA was achieved from DBS extracts. The parasitaemia threshold to achieve {$>$}5× coverage for 50\% of the genome was 0.03\% (40 parasites per 200 white blood cells). Over 99\% SNP concordance between VB and DBS samples was achieved after excluding missing calls. CONCLUSION: The sWGA methods described here provide a reliable and scalable way of generating P. falciparum genome sequence data from DBS samples. The current data indicate that it will be possible to get good quality sequence on most if not all drug resistance loci from the majority of symptomatic malaria patients. This technique overcomes a major limiting factor in P. falciparum genome sequencing from field samples, and paves the way for large-scale epidemiological applications.},

Satellite remote sensing has several advantages for monitoring wetland resources, especially for large geographic areas. This review summarizes the literature on satellite remote sensing of wetlands, including what classification techniques were most successful in identifying wetlands and separating them from other land cover types. All types of wetlands have been studied with satellite remote sensing. Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, and SPOT are the major satellite systems that have been used to study wetlands; other systems are NOAA AVHRR, IRS-1B LISS-II and radar systems, including JERS-1, ERS-1 and RADARSAT. Early work with satellite imagery used visual interpretation for classification. The most commonly used computer classification method to map wetlands is unsupervised classification or clustering. Maximum likelihood is the most common supervised classification method.Wetland classification is difficult because of spectral confusion with other landcover classes and among different types of wetlands. However, multi-temporal data usually improves the classification of wetlands, as does ancillary data such as soil data, elevation or topography data. Classified satellite imagery and maps derived from aerial photography have been compared with the conclusion that they offer different but complimentary information. Change detection studies have taken advantage of the repeat coverage and archival data available with satellite remote sensing. Detailed wetland maps can be updated using satellite imagery. Given the spatial resolution of satellite remote sensing systems, fuzzy classification, subpixel classification, spectral mixture analysis, and mixtures estimation may provide more detailed information on wetlands. A layered, hybrid or rule-based approach may give better results than more traditional methods. The combination of radar and optical data provide the most promise for improving wetland classification},

  abstract = {The incubation period for malaria parasites within the mosquito is exquisitely temperature-sensitive, so that temperature is a major determinant of malaria risk. Epidemiological models are increasingly used to guide allocation of disease control resources and to assess the likely impact of climate change on global malaria burdens. Temperature-based malaria transmission is generally incorporated into these models using mean monthly temperatures, yet temperatures fluctuate throughout the diurnal cycle. Here we use a thermodynamic malaria development model to demonstrate that temperature fluctuation can substantially alter the incubation period of the parasite, and hence malaria transmission rates. We find that, in general, temperature fluctuation reduces the impact of increases in mean temperature. Diurnal temperature fluctuation around means {$>$}21 degrees C slows parasite development compared with constant temperatures, whereas fluctuation around {$<$}21 degrees C speeds development. Consequently, models which ignore diurnal variation overestimate malaria risk in warmer environments and underestimate risk in cooler environments. To illustrate the implications further, we explore the influence of diurnal temperature fluctuation on malaria transmission at a site in the Kenyan Highlands. Based on local meteorological data, we find that the annual epidemics of malaria at this site cannot be explained without invoking the influence of diurnal temperature fluctuation. Moreover, while temperature fluctuation reduces the relative influence of a subtle warming trend apparent over the last 20 years, it nonetheless makes the effects biologically more significant. Such effects of short-term temperature fluctuations have not previously been considered but are central to understanding current malaria transmission and the consequences of climate change.},

Crop type mapping using RS at various temporal and spatial resolutions plays an important role spanning from environmental to economical. The main objective of the current study was to evaluate the significance of optical data in a multi-temporal crop type classification-based on very high spatial resolution and high spatial resolution imagery. With this aim, three images from WorldView-3 and Sentinel-2 were acquired over Coalville (UK) between April and July 2016. Three vegetation indices (VIs); the normalized difference vegetation index, the green normalized difference vegetation index and soil adjusted vegetation index were generated using red, green and near-infrared spectral bands; then a supervised classification was performed using ground reference data collected from field surveys, Random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) classification algorithms. Accuracy assessment was undertaken by comparing the classified output with the reference data. An overall accuracy of 91\% and κ coefficient of 0·90 were estimated using the combination of RF and DT classification algorithms. Therefore, it can be concluded that integrating very high- and high-resolution imagery with different VIs can be implemented effectively to produce large-scale crop maps even with a limited temporal-dataset.},

  abstract = {Effective mapping of water bodies at regional scales is a challenge with respect to the description and monitoring of hydrological, climatic, and landscape processes. In a region as sensitive to climate change as the Arctic, inaccurate representation of lake cover has probably led to underestimation of the role of lakes as landscape constituents and thus of their contribution to biochemical cycles. To estimate lake cover reliably (and perhaps also its change through time), the scientific community necessitates techniques for mapping water bodies using satellite sensors that include rich historical data sets and have sufficiently fine spatial resolution. Here we applied a density-slicing detection technique to 617 cloud-free Landsat images for the summer months 2006–2011. We developed a comprehensive database of Arctic lakes with a detection accuracy of 80\% and examined spatial patterns of lake distribution in relation to landscape properties. We mapped about 3,500,000 lakes; these cover nearly 6\% of the Arctic land surface (about 400,000 km2) and are typically small ({$<$}0.1 km2). Lake density and lake fraction analyses show that lakes are most common in lowland permafrost areas with tundra vegetation. The method described here can also be used to map and monitor lake cover at regional to hemispheric scales and to monitor changes in lake cover over time.},

  abstract = {Crop yield is a key element in rural development and an indicator of national food security. A method that could estimate crop yield over large hilly areas would be highly desirable. Methods including high spatial resolution satellite imagery have the potential to achieve this objective. This paper describes a method of integrating QuickBird imagery with a production efficiency model (PEM) to estimate crop yield in Zhonglianchuan, a hilly area on Loess Plateau, China. In the PEM model, crop yield is a function of the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and light-use efficiency (LUE). Based on the high spatial resolution QuickBird imagery, a land cover classification is used to attribute a class-specific LUE. The fAPARis related to spectral vegetation indices (SVI), which can be derived from the satellite images. The LUE, fAPARand incident PAR data were combined to estimate the crop yield. Farmer-reported crop yield data in 80 representative plots were used to validate the model output. The results indicated QuickBird imagery can improve the accuracy of predicted results relative to the Landsat TM image. The predicted yield approximated well with the data reported by the farmers (r2= 0.86; n = 80). The spatial distributions of crop yield derived here also offers valuable information to manage agricultural production and understand ecosystem functioning. © 2008.},

These requirements, despite their prevalence, lead to computationally harder algorithmic solutions and have been sparsely examined in the literature to date. In this article we prove some unique properties of most parsimonious live phylogenetic trees with polytomies, and their mapping to traditional binary phylogenetic trees. We show that our problem reduces to finding the most compact parsimonious tree for n species, and describe a novel efficient algorithm to find such trees without resorting to exhaustive enumeration of all possible tree topologies.},

While this is likely to take many forms, the implications for future transmission of vector-borne diseases (VBDs), given their ongoing contribution to global disease burden, are both extremely important and highly uncertain. In part, this is owing not only to data limitations and methodological challenges when integrating climate-driven VBD models and climate change projections, but also, perhaps most crucially, to the multitude of epidemiological, ecological and socio-economic factors that drive VBD transmission, and this complexity has generated considerable debate over the past 10–15 years. In this review, we seek to elucidate current knowledge around this topic, identify key themes and uncertainties, evaluate ongoing challenges and open research questions and, crucially, offer some solutions for the field.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria in Southeast Asia frequently clusters along international borders. For example, while most of Thailand is malaria free, the border region shared with Myanmar continues to have endemic malaria. This spatial pattern is the result of complex interactions between landscape, humans, mosquito vectors, and malaria parasites. An understanding of these complex ecological and socio-cultural interactions is important for designing and implementing malaria elimination efforts in the region. This article offers an ecological perspective on the malaria situation along the Thailand-Myanmar border. DISCUSSION: This border region is long (2000 km), mountainous, and the environment ranges from thick forests to growing urban settlements and wet-rice fields. It is also a biologically diverse region. All five species of malaria known to naturally infect humans are present. At least three mosquito vector species complexes, with widely varying behavioural characteristics, exist in the area. The region is also a hub for ethnic diversity, being home to over ten different ethnolinguistic groups, several of which have been engaged in conflict with the Myanmar government now for over half a century. Given the biological and ethnic diversity, as well as the complex socio-political context, malaria control and elimination in the region is challenging. CONCLUSION: Despite these complexities, multipronged approaches including collaborations with multiple local organizations, quick access to diagnosis and treatment, prevention of mosquito bites, radical cure of parasites, and mass drug administration appear to be drastically decreasing Plasmodium falciparum infections. Such approaches remain crucial as the region moves toward elimination of P. falciparum and potentially Plasmodium vivax.},

  abstract = {Cambodia, in which both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are endemic, has been the focus of numerous malaria-control interventions, resulting in a marked decline in overall malaria incidence. Despite this decline, the number of P vivax cases has actually increased. To understand better the factors underlying this resilience, we compared the genetic responses of the two species to recent selective pressures. We sequenced and studied the genomes of 70 P vivax and 80 P falciparum isolates collected between 2009 and 2013. We found that although P falciparum has undergone population fracturing, the coendemic P vivax population has grown undisrupted, resulting in a larger effective population size, no discernable population structure, and frequent multiclonal infections. Signatures of selection suggest recent, species-specific evolutionary differences. Particularly, in contrast to P falciparum, P vivax transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, and histone deacetylases have undergone strong directional selection, including a particularly strong selective sweep at an AP2 transcription factor. Together, our findings point to different population-level adaptive mechanisms used by P vivax and P falciparum parasites. Although population substructuring in P falciparum has resulted in clonal outgrowths of resistant parasites, P vivax may use a nuanced transcriptional regulatory approach to population maintenance, enabling it to preserve a larger, more diverse population better suited to facing selective threats. We conclude that transcriptional control may underlie P vivax's resilience to malaria control measures. Novel strategies to target such processes are likely required to eradicate P vivax and achieve malaria elimination.},

In total, 43 scientific papers met the inclusion criteria and were considered in this review. Researchers have examined a wide variety of methodologies ranging from statistical to machine learning algorithms. A number of studies used models and EO data that seemed promising and claimed to be easily replicated in different geographic contexts, enabling the realization of systems on regional and national scales. The need has emerged to leverage furthermore new powerful modeling approaches, like artificial intelligence and ensemble modeling and explore new and enhanced EO sensors towards the analysis of big satellite data, in order to develop accurate epidemiological models and contribute to the reduction of the burden of MBDs.},

  abstract = {In malaria, individuals are often infected with different parasite strains. The complexity of infection (COI) is defined as the number of genetically distinct parasite strains in an individual. Changes in the mean COI in a population have been shown to be informative of changes in transmission intensity with a number of probabilistic likelihood and Bayesian models now developed to estimate the COI. However, rapid, direct measures based on heterozygosity or FwS do not properly represent the COI. In this work, we present two new methods that use easily calculated measures to directly estimate the COI from allele frequency data. Using a simulation framework, we show that our methods are computationally efficient and comparably accurate to current approaches in the literature. Through a sensitivity analysis, we characterize how the distribution of parasite densities, the assumed sequencing depth, and the number of sampled loci impact the bias and accuracy of our two methods. Using our developed methods, we further estimate the COI globally from Plasmodium falciparum sequencing data and compare the results against the literature. We show significant differences in the estimated COI globally between continents and a weak relationship between malaria prevalence and COI.},

We also uncover a general "phase change" phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

Further characterization and comparability of the hidden asymptomatic parasite reservoir are needed to inform on the potential impact of sampling bias. This study explores the impact of sampling strategy on molecular surveillance by comparing the genetic make-up of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax isolates collected by passive versus active case detection. Sympatric isolates of P. falciparum and P. vivax were collected from a large community survey and ongoing clinical surveillance studies undertaken in the hypomesoendemic setting of Mimika District (Papua, Indonesia). Plasmodium falciparum isolates were genotyped at nine microsatellite loci and P. vivax at eight loci. Measures of diversity and differentiation were used to compare different patient and parasitological sample groups. The results demonstrated that passively detected cases (symptomatic) had comparable population diversity to those circulating in the community (asymptomatic) in both species. In addition, asymptomatic patent infections were as diverse as subpatent infections. However, a significant difference in multiplicity of infection (MOI) and percentage of polyclonal infections was observed between actively and passively detected P. vivax cases (mean MOI: 1.7 ± 0.7 versus 1.4 ± 1.4, respectively; P = 0.001). The study findings infer that, in hypomesoendemic settings, passive sampling is appropriate for molecular parasite surveillance strategies using the predominant clone in any given infection; however, the findings suggest caution when analyzing complexity of infection. Further evaluation is required in other endemic settings.},

Our method is a generalization of the neighbor-joining method of Saitou and Nei and affords a more thorough sampling of the solution space by keeping track of multiple partial solutions during its execution. The scope of the solution space sampling is controlled by a pair of user-specified parameters--the total number of alternate solutions and the number of alternate solutions that are randomly selected--effecting a smooth trade-off between run time and solution quality and diversity. This method can discover topologically distinct low-cost solutions. In tests on biological and synthetic data sets using either the least-squares distance or minimum-evolution criterion, the method consistently performed as well as, or better than, both the neighbor-joining heuristic and the PHYLIP implementation of the Fitch-Margoliash distance measure. In addition, the method identified alternative tree topologies with costs within 1\% or 2\% of the best, but with topological distances of 9 or more partitions from the best solution (16 taxa); with 32 taxa, topologies were obtained 17 (least-squares) and 22 (minimum-evolution) partitions from the best topology when 200 partial solutions were retained. Thus, the method can find lower-cost tree topologies and near-best tree topologies that are significantly different from the best topology.},

In particular, it makes the calculation, simultaneous fitting, and visualisation of a large number of direct and cross (residual) variograms very easy. Gstat was started 10 years ago and was released under the GPL in 1996; gstat.org was started in 1998. Gstat was not initially written for teaching purposes, but for research purposes, emphasising flexibility, scalability and portability. It can deal with a large number of practical issues in geostatistics, including change of support (block kriging), simple/ordinary/universal (co)kriging, fast local neighbourhood selection, flexible trend modelling, variables with different sampling configurations, and efficient simulation of large spatially correlated random fields, indicator kriging and simulation, and (directional) variogram and cross variogram modelling. The formula/models interface of the S language is used to define multivariable geostatistical models. This paper introduces the gstat S package, and discusses a number of design and implementation issues. It also draws attention to a number of papers on integration of spatial statistics software, GIS and the S environment that were presented on the spatial statistics workshop and sessions during the conference Distributed Statistical Computing 2003.},

  abstract = {Background Sample size calculations for cluster randomized trials are a recognized methodological challenge for malaria research in pre-elimination settings. Positively correlated responses from the participants in the same cluster are a key feature in the estimated sample size required for a cluster randomized trial. The degree of correlation is measured by the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) where a higher coefficient suggests a closer correlation hence less heterogeneity within clusters but more heterogeneity between clusters. Methods Data on uPCR-detected Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections from a recent cluster randomized trial which aimed at interrupting malaria transmission through mass drug administrations were used to calculate the ICCs for prevalence and incidence of Plasmodium infections. The trial was conducted in four countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and Cambodia. Exact and simulation approaches were used to estimate ICC values for both the prevalence and the incidence of parasitaemia. In addition, the latent variable approach to estimate ICCs for the prevalence was utilized. Results The ICCs for prevalence ranged between 0.001 and 0.082 for all countries. The ICC from the combined 16 villages in the Greater Mekong Subregion were 0.26 and 0.21 for P. falciparum and P. vivax respectively. The ICCs for incidence of parasitaemia ranged between 0.002 and 0.075 for Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam. There were very high ICCs for incidence in the range of 0.701 to 0.806 in Laos during follow-up. Conclusion ICC estimates can help researchers when designing malaria cluster randomized trials. A high variability in ICCs and hence sample size requirements between study sites was observed. Realistic sample size estimates for cluster randomized malaria trials in the Greater Mekong Subregion have to assume high between cluster heterogeneity and ICCs. This work focused on uPCR-detected infections; there remains a need to develop more ICC references for trials designed around prevalence and incidence of clinical outcomes. Adequately powered trials are critical to estimate the benefit of interventions to malaria in a reliable and reproducible fashion.},

We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change14 is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal15, 16. Losses in Australia17 and the USA18 linked to long-term droughts are also evident. This globally consistent, validated data set shows that impacts of climate change and climate oscillations on surface water occurrence can be measured and that evidence can be gathered to show how surface water is altered by human activities. We anticipate that this freely available data will improve the modelling of surface forcing, provide evidence of state and change in wetland ecotones (the transition areas between biomes), and inform water-management decision-making.},

  abstract = {In the face of global population growth and the uneven distribution of water supply, a better knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water resources is critical. Remote sensing provides a synoptic view of ongoing processes, which addresses the intricate nature of water surfaces and allows an assessment of the pressures placed on aquatic ecosystems. However, the main challenge in identifying water surfaces from remotely sensed data is the high variability of spectral signatures, both in space and time. In the last 10. years only a few operational methods have been proposed to map or monitor surface water at continental or global scale, and each of them show limitations. The objectives of this study are to develop, demonstrate and validate the adequacy of a generic multi-temporal and multi-spectral image analysis method to detect water surfaces automatically, and to monitor them in near real-time at the African continental scale as a first step towards global scale coverage. The proposed approach, based on a transformation of the RGB color space into HSV, provides dynamic information at the continental scale. Two different validations were done at the continental scale over Africa: i) The algorithm validation checked the ability of the proposed algorithm to perform as effectively as human interpretation of the image: it showed an accuracy of 96.6\% and no commission errors. ii) The product validation was carried out by using an independent dataset derived from high resolution imagery: the continental permanent water surface product showed an accuracy of 91.5\% and few commission errors. Potential applications of the proposed method have been identified and discussed. The methodology that has been developed is generic: it can be applied to sensors with similar bands with good reliability, and minimal effort. Moreover, this experiment at the African continental scale showed that the methodology is efficient for a large range of environmental conditions. Additional preliminary tests over other continents indicate that the proposed methodology could also be applied at the global scale without too many difficulties.© 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The burden of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria in Kenya is decreasing; however, it is still one of the top 10 causes of morbidity, particularly in regions of western Kenya. Between April 2015 and June 2016, we enrolled 965 apparently healthy children aged 0-15 years in former Nyanza and Western Provinces in Kenya to characterize the demographic, geographic, and household risk factors of asymptomatic malaria as part of an epidemiologic study to investigate the risk factors for endemic Burkitt lymphoma. The children were sampled using a stratified, multistage cluster sampling survey design. Malaria was assessed by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and thick-film microscopy (TFM). Primary analyses of Pf malaria prevalence (pfPR) are based on RDT. Associations between weighted pfPR and potential risk factors were evaluated using logistic regression, accounting for the survey design. Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence was 36.0\% (27.5\%, 44.5\%) by RDT and 22.3\% (16.0\%, 28.6\%) by TFM. Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence was positively associated with living in the lake-endemic area (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.46; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 1.63, 7.37), paternal occupation as peasant farmer (aOR 1.87; 1.08, 3.26) or manual laborer (aOR 1.83; 1.00, 3.37), and keeping dogs (aOR 1.62; 0.98-2.69) or cows (aOR 1.52; 0.96-2.40) inside or near the household. Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence was inversely associated with indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS) (aOR 0.44; 0.19, 1.01), having a household connected to electricity (aOR 0.47; 0.22, 0.98), and a household with two (aOR 0.45; 0.22, 0.93) or ≥ three rooms (aOR 0.41; 0.18, 0.93). We report high but geographically heterogeneous pfPR in children in western Kenya and significant associations with IRS and household-level socioeconomic factors.},

The spatial structure differed somewhat between the tree-based measurements (yield, size and vigor) and the soil properties. Yield, trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, used as a surrogate for vigor) were strongly spatially clustered as indicated by the global Moran’s I for these measurements. The autocorrelation between trees (determined by applying a localized Moran’s I) was greater in some areas than others, suggesting possible management by zones. The variogram ranges for TCSA and yield were 30–45\&nbsp;m, respectively, but large nugget variances indicated considerable variability from tree to tree. The variogram ranges of NDVI varied from about 14–27\&nbsp;m. The soil properties copper, iron, organic matter and total exchange capacity (TEC) were spatially structured, with longer variogram ranges than those of the tree characteristics: 31–95\&nbsp;m. Boron, pH and zinc were not spatially correlated. The GWR analyses supported the results from the other analyses indicating that assumptions of strict stationarity might be violated, so regression models fitted to the entire dataset might not be fitted optimally to spatial clusters of the data.},

The resolution of the input image data ranges from 0.5 to 10 meters, collected by a heterogeneous set of platforms including satellite SPOT (2 and 5), CBERS 2B, RapidEye (2 and 4), WorldView (1 and 2), GeoEye 1, QuickBird 2, Ikonos 2, and airborne sensors. Several imaging modes were tested including panchromatic, multispectral and pan-sharpened images. A new fully automatic image information extraction, generalization and mosaic workflow is presented that is based on multiscale textural and morphological image features extraction. New image feature compression and optimization are introduced, together with new learning and classification techniques allowing for the processing of HR/VHR image data using low-resolution thematic layers as reference. A new systematic approach for quality control and validation allowing global spatial and thematic consistency checking is proposed and applied. The quality of the results are discussed by sensor, band, resolution, and eco-regions. Critical points, lessons learned and next steps are highlighted.},

It is the most spatially global detailed data available today dedicated to hu- man settlements, and it shows the greatest temporal depth. The core processing methodology relies on a new supervised classifica- tion paradigm based on symbolic machine learning. The informa- tion is extracted from Landsat image records organized in four col- lections corresponding to the epochs 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2014. The experiment reported here is the first known attempt to exploit global Multispectral Scanner data for historical land cover assess- ment. As primary goal, the Landsat-made Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) reports about the presence of built-up areas in the different epochs at the spatial resolution allowed by the Landsat sen- sor. Preliminary tests confirm that the quality of the information on built-up areas delivered by GHSL is better than other available global information layers extracted by automatic processing from Earth Ob- servation data. An experimental multiple-class land-cover product is also produced from the epoch 2014 collection using low-resolution space-derived products as training set. The classification schema of the settlement distinguishes built-up areas based on vegetation contents and volume of buildings, the latter estimated from integra- tion of SRTM and ASTER-GDEM data. On the overall, the experiment demonstrated a step forward in production of land cover information from global fine-scale satellite data using automatic and reproducible methodology.},

  abstract = {Context Landscape resistance surfaces are often used to address questions related to movement, dispersal, or population connectivity. However, modeling landscape resistance is complicated by the selection of the most appropriate analytical approach and the assignment of resistance values to landscape features. Objectives We compare three common approaches used in landscape genetics to assign resistance values to landscape features and assess the ability of each approach to correctly identify the data generating resistance surfaces from competing resistance surfaces, as well as the accuracy of each method in recreating the true resistance surface. Methods Using simulated genetic data and landscape resistance surfaces, three optimization approaches were evaluated: constrained optimization using reciprocal causal modeling (RCM-CO), constrained optimization using linear mixed effects (MLPE-CO) models, and true optimization using ResistanceGA, which combines MLPE models with a genetic algorithm. Results All methods had low type I error (20\% or less) when the simulated surface was continuous, but only MLPE-CO and ResistanceGA had low type I error (10\% or less) when the simulated surface was categorical. Error was substantially lower with ResistanceGA than MLPE-CO or RCM-CO for multivariate surfaces. Correlation between true and optimized resistance surfaces was generally high with MLPE-CO and ResistanceGA, but low with RCM-CO. Conclusions MLPE-based approaches (ResistanceGA and MLPE-CO) were superior to RCM-CO, highlighting their value for landscape genetic analyses. The overall performance, objectivity, and accessibility of ResistanceGA underscore its value as a tool for inferring resistance values from genetic data to better understand how landscapes affect dispersal, movement and population connectivity.},

However, parameterization of resistance surfaces that best describe connectivity is a challenging and often subjective process. ResistanceGA is an R package that utilizes a genetic algorithm to optimize resistance surfaces based on pairwise genetic data and effective distances calculated using CIRCUITSCAPE, least cost paths or random-walk commute times. Functions in this package allow for the optimization of categorical and continuous resistance surfaces, and simultaneous optimization of multiple resistance surfaces. ResistanceGA provides a coherent framework to optimize resistance surfaces without a priori assumptions, conduct model selection, and make inference about the contribution of each surface to total resistance. ResistanceGA fills a void in the landscape genetic toolbox, allowing for unbiased optimization of resistance surfaces and for the simultaneous optimization of multiple resistance surfaces to create novel composite resistance surfaces, but could have broader applicability to other fields of spatial ecological research.},

  abstract = {The field of landscape genetics has been rapidly evolving, adopting and adapting analytical frameworks to address research questions. Current studies are increasingly using regression-based frameworks to infer the individual contributions of landscape and habitat variables on genetic differentiation. This paper outlines appropriate and inappropriate uses of multiple regression for these purposes, and demonstrates through simulation the limitations of different analytical frameworks for making correct inference. Of particular concern are recent studies seeking to explain genetic differences by fitting regression models with effective distance variables calculated independently on separate landscape resistance surfaces. When moving across the landscape, organisms cannot respond independently and uniquely to habitat and landscape features. Analyses seeking to understand how landscape features affect gene flow should model a single conductance or resistance surface as a parameterized function of relevant spatial covariates, and estimate the values of these parameters by linking a single set of resistance distances to observed genetic dissimilarity via a loss function. While this loss function may involve a regression-like step, the associated nuisance parameters are not interpretable in terms of organismal movement and should not be conflated with what is actually of interest: the mapping between spatial covariates and conductance/resistance. The growth and evolution of landscape genetics as a field has been rapid and exciting. It is the goal of this paper to highlight past missteps and demonstrate limitations of current approaches to ensure that future use of regression models will appropriately consider the process being modeled, which will provide clarity to model interpretation.},

  abstract = {A basic understanding of how the landscape impedes, or creates resistance to, the dispersal of organisms and hence gene flow is paramount for successful conservation science and management. Spatially structured ecological networks are often used to represent spatial landscape-genetic relationships, where nodes represent individuals or populations and resistance to movement is represented using non-binary edge weights. Weights are typically assigned or estimated by the user, rather than observed, and validating such weights is challenging. We provide a synthesis of current methods used to estimate edge weights and an overview of common model types, stressing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and their ability to model landscape-genetic data. We further explore a set of spatial-statistical methods that provide ecologists with alternative approaches for modeling spatially explicit processes that may affect genetic structure. This includes an overview of spatial autoregressive models, with a particular focus on how correlation and partial correlation are used to represent neighborhood structure with the inverse of the covariance matrix (i.e., precision matrix). We then demonstrate how to model resistance by specifying an appropriate statistical model on the nodes, conditioned on the edge weights, through the precision matrix. This integration of network ecology and spatial statistics provides a practical analytical framework for landscape-genetic studies. The results can be used to make statistical inferences about the relative importance of individual landscape characteristics, such as the vegetative cover, hillslope, or the presence of roads or rivers, on gene flow. In addition, the R code we include allows readers to explore landscape-genetic structure in their own datasets, which will potentially provide new insights into the evolutionary processes that generated ecological networks, as well as valuable information about the optimal characteristics of conservation corridors.},

We can expect that, in the near future, the hydrologic behavior of many urban and periurban catchments will reflect this diffusion. This paper discusses SC regulations through two complementary approaches: starting on three French case-studies, it analyzes how regulations are developed today and identifies a set of shortcuts in policy-making practices. Then, the hydrologic model of a periurban catchment in the Paris region is used to test the impacts that these regulations can produce if widely applied. The main finding is that inertia in policy-making, driving a singular focus on flow-rate based regulations, can produce negative impacts in the long-term. Further efforts on volume-based regulations are advocated, both in terms of research and policy-making. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) has worked to assemble and maintain a global open-access database of spatial malariometric data for over a decade. This data spans various formats and topics, including: geo-located surveys of malaria parasite rate; global administrative boundary shapefiles; and global and regional rasters representing the distribution of malaria and associated illnesses, blood disorders, and intervention coverage. MAP has recently released malariaAtlas, an R package providing a direct interface to MAP's routinely-updated malariometric databases and research outputs. METHODS AND RESULTS: The current paper reviews the functionality available in malariaAtlas and highlights its utility for spatial epidemiological analysis of malaria. malariaAtlas enables users to freely download, visualise and analyse global malariometric data within R. Currently available data types include: malaria parasite rate and vector occurrence point data; subnational administrative boundary shapefiles; and a large suite of rasters covering a diverse range of metrics related to malaria research. malariaAtlas is here used in two mock analyses to illustrate how this data may be incorporated into a standard R workflow for spatial analysis. CONCLUSIONS: malariaAtlas is the first open-access R-interface to malariometric data, providing a new and reproducible means of accessing such data within a freely available and commonly used statistical software environment. In this way, the malariaAtlas package aims to contribute to the environment of data-sharing within the malaria research community.},

  abstract = {Although many computer programs can perform population genetics calculations, they are typically limited in the analyses and data input formats they offer; few applications can process the large data sets produced by whole-genome resequencing projects. Furthermore, there is no coherent framework for the easy integration of new statistics into existing pipelines, hindering the development and application of new population genetics and genomics approaches. Here, we present PopGenome, a population genomics package for the R software environment (a de facto standard for statistical analyses). PopGenome can efficiently process genome-scale data as well as large sets of individual loci. It reads DNA alignments and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data sets in most common formats, including those used by the HapMap, 1000 human genomes, and 1001 Arabidopsis genomes projects. PopGenome also reads associated annotation files in GFF format, enabling users to easily define regions or classify SNPs based on their annotation; all analyses can also be applied to sliding windows. PopGenome offers a wide range of diverse population genetics analyses, including neutrality tests as well as statistics for population differentiation, linkage disequilibrium, and recombination. PopGenome is linked to Hudson's MS and Ewing's MSMS programs to assess statistical significance based on coalescent simulations. PopGenome's integration in R facilitates effortless and reproducible downstream analyses as well as the production of publication-quality graphics. Developers can easily incorporate new analyses methods into the PopGenome framework.

They proposed that the enduring association results because SES embodies an array of resources, such as money, knowledge, prestige, power, and beneficial social connections that protect health no matter what mechanisms are relevant at any given time. In this article, we explicate the theory, review key findings, discuss refinements and limits to the theory, and discuss implications for health policies that might reduce health inequalities. We advocate policies that encourage medical and other health-promoting advances while at the same time breaking or weakening the link between these advances and socioeconomic resources. This can be accomplished either by reducing disparities in socioeconomic resources themselves or by developing interventions that, by their nature, are more equally distributed across SES groups.},

A framework is presented for use by environmental scientists and managers, enabling their spatial data collection needs to be linked to a suitable form of remotely sensed data. A six-step approach is used, combining image spatial analysis and scaling tools, within the context of hierarchy theory. The main steps involved are: (1) identification of information requirements for the monitoring or management problem; (2) development of ideal image dimensions (scene model), (3) exploratory analysis of existing remotely sensed data using scaling techniques, (4) selection and evaluation of suitable remotely sensed data based on the scene model, (5) selection of suitable spatial analytic techniques to meet information requirements, and (6) cost-benefit analysis. Results from a case study show that the framework provided an objective mechanism to identify relevant aspects of the monitoring problem and environmental characteristics for selecting remotely sensed data and analysis techniques.},

  abstract = {Many aspects of the historical relationships between populations in a species are reflected in genetic data. Inferring these relationships from genetic data, however, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present a statistical model for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in multiple populations. In our model, the sampled populations in a species are related to their common ancestor through a graph of ancestral populations. Using genome-wide allele frequency data and a Gaussian approximation to genetic drift, we infer the structure of this graph. We applied this method to a set of 55 human populations and a set of 82 dog breeds and wild canids. In both species, we show that a simple bifurcating tree does not fully describe the data; in contrast, we infer many migration events. While some of the migration events that we find have been detected previously, many have not. For example, in the human data, we infer that Cambodians trace approximately 16\% of their ancestry to a population ancestral to other extant East Asian populations. In the dog data, we infer that both the boxer and basenji trace a considerable fraction of their ancestry (9\% and 25\%, respectively) to wolves subsequent to domestication and that East Asian toy breeds (the Shih Tzu and the Pekingese) result from admixture between modern toy breeds and "ancient" Asian breeds.

An important aspect of antimalarial drug resistance is understanding its geographic distribution. However, specimens submitted to CDC laboratories may have missing, incomplete, or inaccurate travel data. To complement genotyping for drug-resistance markers Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfk13, Pfdhps, Pfdhfr, and PfcytB at CDC, amplicons of Pfs47 and Pfcpmp are also sequenced as markers of geographic origin. Here, a bi-allele likelihood (BALK) classifier was trained using Pfs47 and Pfcpmp sequences from published P. falciparum genomes of known geographic origin to classify clinical genotypes to a continent. Among P. falciparum-positive blood samples received at CDC for drug-resistance genotyping from 2018 to 2021 (n = 380), 240 included a travel history with the submission materials, though 6 were excluded due to low sequence quality. Classifications obtained for the remaining 234 were compared to their travel histories. Classification results were over 96\% congruent with reported travel for clinical samples, and with collection sites for field isolates. Among travel-related samples, only two incongruent results occurred; a specimen submitted citing Costa Rican travel classified to Africa, and a specimen with travel referencing Sierra Leone classified to Asia. Subsequently, the classifier was applied to specimens with unreported travel histories (n = 140; 5 were excluded due to low sequence quality). For the remaining 135 samples, geographic classification data were paired with results generated using CDC's Malaria Resistance Surveillance (MaRS) protocol, which detects single-nucleotide polymorphisms in and generates haplotypes for Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfk13, Pfdhps, Pfdhfr, and PfcytB. Given the importance of understanding the geographic distribution of antimalarial drug resistance, this work will complement domestic surveillance efforts by expanding knowledge on the geographic origin of drug-resistant P. falciparum entering the USA.},

  abstract = {In their competition for hosts, parasites with antigens that are novel to the host immune system will be at a competitive advantage. The resulting frequency-dependent selection can structure parasite populations into strains of limited genetic overlap. For the causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, the high recombination rates and associated vast diversity of its highly antigenic and multicopy var genes preclude such clear clustering in endemic regions. This undermines the definition of strains as specific, temporally persisting gene variant combinations. We use temporal multilayer networks to analyze the genetic similarity of parasites in both simulated data and in an extensively and longitudinally sampled population in Ghana. When viewed over time, populations are structured into modules (i.e., groups) of parasite genomes whose var gene combinations are more similar within than between the modules and whose persistence is much longer than that of the individual genomes that compose them. Comparison to neutral models that retain parasite population dynamics but lack competition reveals that the selection imposed by host immunity promotes the persistence of these modules. The modular structure is, in turn, associated with a slower acquisition of immunity by individual hosts. Modules thus represent dynamically generated niches in host immune space, which can be interpreted as strains. Negative frequency-dependent selection therefore shapes the organization of the var diversity into parasite genomes, leaving a persistence signature over ecological time scales. Multilayer networks extend the scope of phylodynamics analyses by allowing quantification of temporal genetic structure in organisms that generate variation via recombination or other non-bifurcating processes. A strain structure similar to the one described here should apply to other pathogens with large antigenic spaces that evolve via recombination. For malaria, the temporal modular structure should enable the formulation of tractable epidemiological models that account for parasite antigenic diversity and its influence on intervention outcomes.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The quantification of parasite movements can provide valuable information for control strategy planning across all transmission intensities. Mobile parasite carrying individuals can instigate transmission in receptive areas, spread drug resistant strains and reduce the effectiveness of control strategies. The identification of mobile demographic groups, their routes of travel and how these movements connect differing transmission zones, potentially enables limited resources for interventions to be efficiently targeted over space, time and populations. METHODS: National population censuses and household surveys provide individual-level migration, travel, and other data relevant for understanding malaria movement patterns. Together with existing spatially referenced malaria data and mathematical models, network analysis techniques were used to quantify the demographics of human and malaria movement patterns in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Movement networks were developed based on connectivity and magnitudes of flow within each country and compared to assess relative differences between regions and demographic groups. Additional malaria-relevant characteristics, such as short-term travel and bed net use, were also examined. RESULTS: Patterns of human and malaria movements varied between demographic groups, within country regions and between countries. Migration rates were highest in 20-30 year olds in all three countries, but when accounting for malaria prevalence, movements in the 10-20 year age group became more important. Different age and sex groups also exhibited substantial variations in terms of the most likely sources, sinks and routes of migration and malaria movement, as well as risk factors for infection, such as short-term travel and bed net use. CONCLUSION: Census and survey data, together with spatially referenced malaria data, GIS and network analysis tools, can be valuable for identifying, mapping and quantifying regional connectivities and the mobility of different demographic groups. Demographically-stratified HPM and malaria movement estimates can provide quantitative evidence to inform the design of more efficient intervention and surveillance strategies that are targeted to specific regions and population groups.},

  abstract = {Recent increases in funding for malaria control have led to the reduction in transmission in many malaria endemic countries, prompting the national control programmes of 36 malaria endemic countries to set elimination targets. Accounting for human population movement (HPM) in planning for control, elimination and post-elimination surveillance is important, as evidenced by previous elimination attempts that were undermined by the reintroduction of malaria through HPM. Strategic control and elimination planning, therefore, requires quantitative information on HPM patterns and the translation of these into parasite dispersion. HPM patterns and the risk of malaria vary substantially across spatial and temporal scales, demographic and socioeconomic sub-groups, and motivation for travel, so multiple data sets are likely required for quantification of movement. While existing studies based on mobile phone call record data combined with malaria transmission maps have begun to address within-country HPM patterns, other aspects remain poorly quantified despite their importance in accurately gauging malaria movement patterns and building control and detection strategies, such as cross-border HPM, demographic and socioeconomic stratification of HPM patterns, forms of transport, personal malaria protection and other factors that modify malaria risk. A wealth of data exist to aid filling these gaps, which, when combined with spatial data on transport infrastructure, traffic and malaria transmission, can answer relevant questions to guide strategic planning. This review aims to (i) discuss relevant types of HPM across spatial and temporal scales, (ii) document where datasets exist to quantify HPM, (iii) highlight where data gaps remain and (iv) briefly put forward methods for integrating these datasets in a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework for analysing and modelling human population and Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection movements.},

  abstract = {Visualisation of spatial networks based on pairwise metrics such as (dis)similarity coefficients provides direct information on spatial organisation of biological systems. However, for large networks, graphical representations are often unreadable as nodes (samples), and edges (links between samples) strongly overlap. We present a new method, MAPI, allowing translation from spatial networks to variation surfaces. MAPI relies on (i) a spatial network in which samples are linked by ellipses and (ii) a grid of hexagonal cells encompassing the study area. Pairwise metric values are attributed to ellipses and averaged within the cells they intersect. The resulting surface of variation can be displayed as a colour map in Geographical Information System (GIS), along with other relevant layers, such as land cover. The method also allows the identification of significant discontinuities in grid cell values through a nonparametric randomisation procedure. The interest of MAPI is here demonstrated in the field of spatial and landscape genetics. Using simulated test data sets, as well as observed data from three biological models, we show that MAPI is (i) relatively insensitive to confounding effects resulting from isolation by distance (i.e. over-structuring), (ii) efficient in detecting barriers when they are not too permeable to gene flow and, (iii) useful to explore relationships between spatial genetic patterns and landscape features. MAPI is freely provided as a PostgreSQL/PostGIS data base extension allowing easy interaction with GIS or the r software and other programming languages. Although developed for spatial and landscape genetics, the method can also be useful to visualise spatial organisation from other kinds of data from which pairwise metrics can be computed.},

To overcome these constraints, we combine the advantages of a machine-learning framework and an iterative optimization process to develop a method for integrating genetic and environmental (e.g., climate, land cover, human infrastructure) data. We validate and demonstrate this method for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, an invasive species and the primary vector of dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika. We test two contrasting metrics to approximate genetic distance and find Cavalli-Sforza-Edwards distance (CSE) performs better than linearized FST The correlation (R) between the model's predicted genetic distance and actual distance is 0.83. We produce a map of genetic connectivity for Ae. aegypti's range in North America and discuss which environmental and anthropogenic variables are most important for predicting gene flow, especially in the context of vector control.},

  abstract = {Lake Chad, located in the middle of the African Sahel belt, underwent dramatic decreases in the 1970s and 1980s leaving less than ten percent of its 1960s surface water extent as open water. In this paper, we present an extended record (dry seasons 1988–2016) of the total surface water area of the lake (including both open water and flooded vegetation) derived using Land Surface Temperature (LST) data (dry seasons 2000–2016) from the NASA Terra MODIS sensor and EUMETSAT Meteosat-based LST measurements (dry seasons 1988–2001) from an earlier study. We also examine the total surface water area for Lake Chad using radar data (dry seasons 2015–2016) from the ESA Sentinel-1a mission. For the limited number of radar data sets available to us (18 data sets), we find on average a close match between the estimates from these data and the corresponding estimates from LST, though we find spatial differences in the estimates using the two types of data. We use these spatial differences to adjust the record (dry seasons 2000–2016) from MODIS LST. Then we use the adjusted record to remove the bias of the existing LST record (dry seasons 1988–2001) derived from Meteosat measurements and combine the two records. From this composite, extended record, we plot the total surface water area of the lake for the dry seasons of 1988–1989 through 2016–2017. We find for the dry seasons of 1988–1989 to 2016–2017 that the maximum total surface water area of the lake was approximately 16,800 sq. km (February and May, 2000), the minimum total surface water area of the lake was approximately 6400 sq. km (November, 1990), and the average was approximately 12,700 sq. km.

  abstract = {This volume provides in-depth coverage of the latest in remote sensing of hydrological extremes: both floods and droughts. The book is divided into two distinct sections – floods and droughts – and offers a variety of techniques for monitoring each. With rapid advances in computer modelling and observing systems, floods and droughts are studied with greater precision today than ever before. Land surface models, especially over the entire Continental United States, can map the hydrological cycle at kilometre and sub-kilometre scales. In the case of smaller areas there is even higher spatial resolution and the only limiting factor is the resolution of input data. In-situ sensors are automated and the data is directly relayed to the world wide web for many hydrological variables such as precipitation, soil moisture, surface temperature and heat fluxes. In addition, satellite remote sensing has advanced to providing twice a day repeat observations at kilometre to ten-kilometre spatial scales. We are at a critical juncture in the study of hydrological extremes, and the GPM and SMAP missions as well as the MODIS and GRACE sensors give us more tools and data than were ever available before. A global variety of chapter authors provides wide-ranging perspectives and case studies that will make this book an indispensable resource for researchers, engineers, and even emergency management and insurance professionals who study and/or manage hydrological extremes.},

  abstract = {Lake Chad is an endorheic lake in the Sahel region of Africa at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. The lake, which is well known for its dramatic decrease in surface area during the 1970s and 1980s, experiences an annual flood resulting in a maximum total surface water area generally during February or March, though sometimes earlier or later. People along the shores of Lake Chad make their living fishing, farming, and raising livestock and have a vested interest in knowing when and how extensive the annual flooding will be, particularly those practicing recession farming in which the fertile ground of previously flooded area is used for planting crops. In this study, the authors investigate the relationship between lake and basin parameters, including rainfall, basin evapotranspiration, lake evapotranspiration, lake elevation, total surface water area, and the previous year’s total surface water area, and develop equations for each dry season month (except November) linking total surface water area to the other parameters. The resulting equations allow the user to estimate the December average monthly total surface water area of the lake in late November, and to make the estimates for January to May in early December. Based on the results of a Leave One Out Cross Validation analysis, the equations for lake area are estimated to have an average absolute error ranging from 5.3 percent (for February estimates) to 7.6 percent (for May estimates).},

Objective: The aim of the study was to explore the associations between fatigue, parenting self-efficacy and parenting satisfaction, where parenting stress mediates this relationship. The moderating influence of several 10 contextual factors was also assessed. Method: A sample of 1022 Australian mothers of children aged 0–6 years completed a survey on fatigue, well-being and parenting. Results: Path analysis revealed that the relationship between fatigue and PSE was fully mediated by parenting stress, while the relationship between fatigue and parenting satisfaction was partially mediated by parenting 15 stress. Child gender, employment status, family structure and socio-economic status did not moderate these relationships. Conclusion: Fatigue is a serious health concern for mothers that has potential to adversely affect their level of parenting stress, parenting beliefs and behaviour. Implications for the provision of information and support to manage parent fatigue are discussed.},

Targeted sequencing for P. falciparum has been widely deployed to detect population structure and the geographic spread of antimalarial and diagnostic resistance. However, there are fewer such tools for P. vivax. Leveraging global variation data, we designed four molecular inversion probe (MIP) genotyping panels targeting geographically differentiating SNPs, neutral SNPs, putative antimalarial resistance genes, and vaccine candidate genes. We deployed these MIP panels on 866 infections from the Peruvian Amazon and identified transmission networks with clonality (IBD[identity by descent]{$>$}0.99), copy number variation in Pvdbp and multiple Pvrbps, mutations in antimalarial resistance orthologs, and balancing selection in 13 vaccine candidate genes. Our MIP panels are the broadest genotyping panel currently available and are poised for successful deployment in other regions of P. vivax transmission.},

  abstract = {Plasmodium vivax parasites have a unique dormant stage that can cause relapses weeks or months after the initial infection. These dormant parasites are among the main challenges of vivax malaria control as they constitute a reservoir that is difficult to eliminate. Since field studies are confounded by reinfections and possible recrudescence of drug-resistant parasites, most analyses of P.~vivax relapses have focused on travelers returning from regions of malaria endemicity. However, it is not clear whether these individuals accurately recapitulate the relapse patterns of repeatedly infected individuals residing in areas of endemicity. Here, we present analyses of vivax malaria patients enrolled in a tightly controlled field study in Cambodia. After antimalarial drug treatment was administered, we relocated 20 individuals to a nontransmission area and followed them for 60~days, with blood collection performed every second day. Our analyses reveal that 60\% of the patients relapsed during the monitoring period. Using whole-genome sequencing and high-throughput genotyping, we showed that relapses in Cambodia are often polyclonal and that the relapsing parasites harbor various degrees of relatedness to the parasites present in the initial infection. Our analyses also showed that clone populations differed dynamically, with new clones emerging during the course of the relapsing infections. Overall, our study data show that it is possible to investigate the patterns, dynamics, and diversity of P.~vivax relapses of individuals living in a region of malaria endemicity and reveal that P.~vivax relapses are much more pervasive and complex than previously considered. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT02118090)IMPORTANCEP.~vivax parasites can remain dormant in the liver and relapse weeks or months after the initial infection, greatly complicating malaria control and elimination efforts. The few investigations of this dormant stage have relied on travelers and military personnel returning from areas of malaria endemicity. However, it is not clear whether these individuals, exposed to a limited number of infections, accurately represent the patterns of relapses of individuals living in areas of endemicity, who are repeatedly infected by P.~vivax parasites. Our study combined tightly controlled fieldwork with comprehensive genomic analyses, and our report provides a first opportunity to investigate the patterns, dynamics, and diversity of P.~vivax relapses directly with individuals living in areas of endemicity.},

The review covers STRUCTURE's most commonly used ancestry and frequency models, plus an overview of the main applications of the software in human genetics including case-control association studies (CCAS), population genetics, and forensic analysis. The review is accompanied by supplementary material providing a step-by-step guide to running STRUCTURE.

Identifying genes that control this complex trait will provide critical insights for alfalfa breeding programs. To date, no studies have been published on a deep sequencing-based profiling of the alfalfa transcriptome in response to salinity stress. Observations gathered through research on reference genomes may not always be applicable to alfalfa. In this work, Illumina RNA-sequencing was performed in two alfalfa genotypes contrasting in salt tolerance, in order to estimate a broad spectrum of genes affected by salt stress. A total of 367,619,586 short reads were generated from cDNA libraries originated from roots of both lines. More than 60,000 tentative consensus sequences (TCs) were obtained and, among them, 74.5\% had a significant similarity to proteins in the NCBI database. Mining of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) from all TCs revealed 6,496 SSRs belonging to 3,183 annotated unigenes. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the expression of 1,165 genes, including 86 transcription factors (TFs), was significantly altered under salt stress. About 40\% of differentially expressed genes were assigned to known gene ontology (GO) categories using Arabidopsis GO. A random check of differentially expressed genes by quantitative real-time PCR confirmed the bioinformatic analysis of the RNA-seq data. A number of salt-responsive genes in both tested genotypes were identified and assigned to functional classes, and gene candidates with roles in the adaptation to salinity were proposed. Alfalfa-specific data on salt-responsive genes obtained in this work will be useful in understanding the molecular mechanisms of salinity tolerance in alfalfa.},

We characterized PfACS and studied its role focusing on epigenetic modifications using the var gene family as reporter genes. For this, mutant lines to modulate plasmodial ACS expression by degron-mediated protein degradation and ribozyme-induced transcript decay were created. Additionally, an inhibitor of the human Acetyl-CoA Synthetase 2 was tested for its effectiveness in interfering with PfACS. The knockdown of PfACS or its inhibition resulted in impaired parasite growth. Decreased levels of PfACS also led to differential histone acetylation patterns, altered variant gene expression, and concomitantly decreased cytoadherence of infected red blood cells containing knocked-down parasites. Further, ChIP analysis revealed the presence of PfACS in many loci in ring stage parasites, underscoring its involvement in the regulation of chromatin. Due to its central function in the plasmodial metabolism and significant differences to human ACS, PfACS is an interesting target for drug development.},

To meet the urgent need for better treatments and vaccines, a deeper knowledge of Plasmodium biology and malaria epidemiology is required. An improved understanding of the genomic variation of malaria parasites, especially the most virulent Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) species, has the potential to yield new insights in these areas. High-throughput sequencing and genotyping is generating large amounts of genomic data across multiple parasite populations. The resulting ability to identify informative variants, particularly single-nudeotide polymorphisms (SNPs), will lead to the discovery of intra- and inter-population differences and thus enable the development of genetic barcodes for diagnostic assays and clinical studies. Knowledge of genetic variability underlying drug resistance and other differential phenotypes will also facilitate the identification of novel mutations and contribute to surveillance and stratified medicine applications. The PlasmoView interactive web-browsing tool enables the research community to visualise genomic variation and annotation (eg, biological function) in a geographic setting. The first release contains over 600 000 high-quality SNPs in 631 Pf isolates from laboratory strains and four malaria-endemic regions (West Africa, East Africa, Southeast Asia and Oceania).},

  abstract = {Isolation by distance (IBD) is a natural pattern not readily incorporated into theoretical models nor traditional metrics for differentiating populations, although clinal genetic differentiation can be characteristic of many wildlife species. Landscape features can also drive population structure additive to baseline IBD resulting in differentiation through isolation-by-resistance (IBR). We assessed the population genetic structure of boreal caribou across western Canada using nonspatial (STRUCTURE) and spatial (MEMGENE) clustering methods and investigated the relative contribution of IBD and IBR on genetic variation of 1,221 boreal caribou multilocus genotypes across western Canada. We further introduced a novel approach to compare the partitioning of individuals into management units (MU) and assessed levels of genetic connectivity under different MU scenarios. STRUCTURE delineated five genetic clusters while MEMGENE identified finer-scale differentiation across the study area. IBD was significant and did not differ for males and females both across and among detected genetic clusters. MEMGENE landscape analysis further quantified the proportion of genetic variation contributed by IBD and IBR patterns, allowing for the relative importance of spatial drivers, including roads, water bodies, and wildfires, to be assessed and incorporated into the characterization of population structure for the delineation of MUs. Local population units, as currently delineated in the boreal caribou recovery strategy, do not capture the genetic variation and connectivity of the ecotype across the study area. Here, we provide the tools to assess fine-scale spatial patterns of genetic variation, partition drivers of genetic variation, and evaluate the best management options for maintaining genetic connectivity. Our approach is highly relevant to vagile wildlife species that are of management and conservation concern and demonstrate varying degrees of IBD and IBR with clinal spatial genetic structure that challenges the delineation of discrete population boundaries.},

Zambia's National Malaria Elimination Program recommends reactive case detection (RCD) within 140 m of index households to enhance surveillance and eliminate remaining transmission foci. METHODS: To evaluate whether RCD captures local transmission, we genotyped 26 microsatellites from 106 samples collected from index (n = 27) and secondary (n = 79) cases detected through RCD in the Macha Hospital catchment area between January 2015 and April 2016. RESULTS: Participants from the same RCD event harbored more genetically related parasites than those from different RCD events, suggesting that RCD captures, at least in part, infections related through local transmission. Related parasites clustered in space and time, up to at least 250 m from index households. Spatial analysis identified a putative focal transmission hotspot. CONCLUSIONS: The current RCD strategy detects focal transmission events, although programmatic guidelines to screen within 140 m of index households may fail to capture all secondary cases. This study highlights the utility of parasite genetic data in assessing programmatic interventions, and similar approaches may be useful to malaria elimination programs seeking to tailor intervention strategies to the underlying transmission epidemiology.},

Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

  abstract = {Pairwise measures of neutral genetic differentiation are supposed to contain information about past and ongoing dispersal events and are thus often used as dependent variables in correlative analyses to elucidate how neutral genetic variation is affected by landscape connectivity. However, spatial heterogeneity in the intensity of genetic drift, stemming from variations in population sizes, may inflate variance in measures of genetic differentiation and lead to erroneous or incomplete interpretations in terms of connectivity. Here, we tested the efficiency of two distance-based metrics designed to capture the unique influence of spatial heterogeneity in local drift on genetic differentiation. These metrics are easily computed from estimates of effective population sizes or from environmental proxies for local carrying capacities, and allow us to introduce the hypothesis of Spatial-Heterogeneity-in-Effective-Population-Sizes (SHNe). SHNe can be tested in a way similar to isolation-by-distance or isolation-by-resistance within the classical landscape genetics hypothesis-testing framework. We used simulations under various models of population structure to investigate the reliability of these metrics to quantify the unique contribution of SHNe in explaining patterns of genetic differentiation. We then applied these metrics to an empirical genetic dataset obtained for a freshwater fish (Gobio occitaniae). Simulations showed that SHNe explained up to 60\% of variance in genetic differentiation (measured as Fst) in the absence of gene flow, and up to 20\% when migration rates were as high as 0.10. Furthermore, one of the two metrics was particularly robust to uncertainty in the estimation of effective population sizes (or proxies for carrying capacity). In the empirical dataset, the effect of SHNe on spatial patterns of Fst was five times higher than that of isolation-by-distance, uniquely contributing to 41\% of variance in pairwise Fst. Taking the influence of SHNe into account also allowed decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the upper estimate of effective dispersal distance. We conclude that the use of SHNe metrics in landscape genetics will substantially improve the understanding of evolutionary drivers of genetic variation, providing substantial information as to the actual drivers of patterns of genetic differentiation in addition to traditional measures of Euclidean distance or landscape resistance.},

  abstract = {Direct gradient analyses in spatial genetics provide unique opportunities to describe the inherent complexity of genetic variation in wildlife species and are the object of many methodological developments. However, multicollinearity among explanatory variables is a systemic issue in multivariate regression analyses and is likely to cause serious difficulties in properly interpreting results of direct gradient analyses, with the risk of erroneous conclusions, misdirected research and inefficient or counterproductive conservation measures. Using simulated data sets along with linear and logistic regressions on distance matrices, we illustrate how commonality analysis (CA), a detailed variance-partitioning procedure that was recently introduced in the field of ecology, can be used to deal with nonindependence among spatial predictors. By decomposing model fit indices into unique and common (or shared) variance components, CA allows identifying the location and magnitude of multicollinearity, revealing spurious correlations and thus thoroughly improving the interpretation of multivariate regressions. Despite a few inherent limitations, especially in the case of resistance model optimization, this review highlights the great potential of CA to account for complex multicollinearity patterns in spatial genetics and identifies future applications and lines of research. We strongly urge spatial geneticists to systematically investigate commonalities when performing direct gradient analyses.},

  abstract = {Genetic data are increasingly used in landscape ecology for the indirect assessment of functional connectivity, that is, the permeability of landscape to movements of organisms. Among available tools, matrix correlation analyses (e.g. Mantel tests or mixed models) are commonly used to test for the relationship between pairwise genetic distances and movement costs incurred by dispersing individuals. When organisms are spatially clustered, a population-based sampling scheme (PSS) is usually performed, so that a large number of genotypes can be used to compute pairwise genetic distances on the basis of allelic frequencies. Because of financial constraints, this kind of sampling scheme implies a drastic reduction in the number of sampled aggregates, thereby reducing sampling coverage at the landscape level. We used matrix correlation analyses on simulated and empirical genetic data sets to investigate the efficiency of an individual-based sampling scheme (ISS) in detecting isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-barrier patterns. Provided that pseudo-replication issues are taken into account (e.g. through restricted permutations in Mantel tests), we showed that the use of interindividual measures of genotypic dissimilarity may efficiently replace interpopulation measures of genetic differentiation: the sampling of only three or four individuals per aggregate may be sufficient to efficiently detect specific genetic patterns in most situations. The ISS proved to be a promising methodological alternative to the more conventional PSS, offering much flexibility in the spatial design of sampling schemes and ensuring an optimal representativeness of landscape heterogeneity in data, with few aggregates left unsampled. Each strategy offering specific advantages, a combined use of both sampling schemes is discussed.},

  abstract = {Landscape genetics is emerging as an important way of supporting decision-making in landscape management, in response to the deterioration of matrix permeability due to habitat loss and fragmentation. In line with unremitting methodological developments in landscape genetics, a new analytical procedure was recently proposed as a way of evaluating the effects of landscape gradients on genetic structures. This procedure is based on the computation of inter-individual hierarchical genetic distances (HGD), a metric of genetic differentiation taking into account the hierarchical structure in populations as inferred from clustering algorithms. HGD can be used as dependent variables in multivariate regressions to assess the effects of various landscape predictors on spatial patterns of genetic differentiation. However, multicollinearity may obscure the interpretation of multivariate regressions. We illustrate how regression commonality analyses (CA), a detailed variance partitioning procedure that can be used to deal with multicollinearity issues, can thoroughly improve our understanding of landscape connectivity when HGD are used as a dependent variable, with the red deer Cervus elaphus as an empirical example. Using logistic regression commonality analyses on HGD, we showed that semi-natural open areas, transportation infrastructures and, to a lesser extent, urban areas and rivers, were associated with an increase in hierarchical genetic differentiation in red deer. Regressions based on HGD provided detailed results that could not have been obtained with regressions based on standard genetic distances, with notably additional insights as to the possible influence of linear features such as roads and highways on landscape connectivity. Furthermore, CA helped identify synergistic associations among variables as well as suppressors, thus resolving inconsistencies among hierarchical levels and revealing spurious correlations that may have gone unnoticed in the course of classical regression analyses. We thus recommend the use of regression commonality analysis on hierarchical genetic distances as a promising statistical tool for landscape geneticists.},

  abstract = {Asymptomatic parasite carriers represent a "silent" infective reservoir for malaria transmission and contributes to malaria persistence. However, limited data are available on asymptomatic malaria in Vietnam. Between November 2018 and March 2019, we conducted a malaria epidemiological survey of asymptomatic people (children ≥ 10 years old and adults ≥18 years old, n = 2,809) residing in three communes in Tuy Duc district, Dak Nong province in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. Based on the national stratification of malaria risk, Dak Buk So, Dak Ngo and Quang Truc communes were classified by the National Malaria Control Programme as low, moderate and high malaria endemic areas, respectively. Using participants' finger prick blood samples, malaria parasites were detected by one-step reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The median age (Interquartile Range) for adults and children were 35 years (26-50) and 12 years (11-14), respectively. The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria was 1.7\% (22/1,328), 3.5\% (31/890) and 12.2\% (72/591) for participants from Dak Buk So, Dak Ngo and Quang Truc, respectively. The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria was lower in children compared to adults: 2.6\% (9/352) versus 4.7\% (116/2,457) (Odds Ratio 0.53, 95\% Confidence Interval 0.28 to1.02). Ownership of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets and hammocks was 97.1\%, 99.0\% and 94.7\% for participants in Dak Buk So, Dak Ngo and Quang Truc, respectively, however, only 66.0\%, 57.3\% and 42.8\% of the participants reported using bed nets every night. Of the several risk factors examined, going to the forest two weeks prior to enrolment into the study and sleeping in the forest had a significant association with participants being infected with asymptomatic malaria in Quang Truc, but not in the other two communes. Knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of asymptomatic malaria will help design and evaluate future intervention strategies for malaria elimination in Vietnam.},

Variational methods pose the problem of computing relevant posterior distributions as an optimization problem, allowing us to build on recent advances in optimization theory to develop fast inference tools. In addition, we propose useful heuristic scores to identify the number of populations represented in a data set and a new hierarchical prior to detect weak population structure in the data. We test the variational algorithms on simulated data and illustrate using genotype data from the CEPH-Human Genome Diversity Panel. The variational algorithms are almost two orders of magnitude faster than STRUCTURE and achieve accuracies comparable to those of ADMIXTURE. Furthermore, our results show that the heuristic scores for choosing model complexity provide a reasonable range of values for the number of populations represented in the data, with minimal bias toward detecting structure when it is very weak.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial drugs play a critical role in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality, but their role is mediated by their effectiveness. Effectiveness is defined as the probability that an anti-malarial drug will successfully treat an individual infected with malaria parasites under routine health care delivery system. Anti-malarial drug effectiveness (AmE) is influenced by drug resistance, drug quality, health system quality, and patient adherence to drug use; its influence on malaria burden varies through space and time. METHODS: This study uses data from 232 efficacy trials comprised of 86,776 infected individuals to estimate the artemisinin-based and non-artemisinin-based AmE for treating falciparum malaria between 1991 and 2019. Bayesian spatiotemporal models were fitted and used to predict effectiveness at the pixel-level (5~km\,×\,5~km). The median and interquartile ranges (IQR) of AmE are presented for all malaria-endemic countries. RESULTS: The global effectiveness of artemisinin-based drugs was 67.4\% (IQR: 33.3-75.8), 70.1\% (43.6-76.0) and 71.8\% (46.9-76.4) for the 1991-2000, 2006-2010, and 2016-2019 periods, respectively. Countries in central Africa, a few in South America, and in the Asian region faced the challenge of lower effectiveness of artemisinin-based anti-malarials. However, improvements were seen after 2016, leaving only a few hotspots in Southeast Asia where resistance to artemisinin and partner drugs is currently problematic and in the central Africa where socio-demographic challenges limit effectiveness. The use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) with a competent partner drug and having multiple ACT as first-line treatment choice sustained high levels of effectiveness. High levels of access to healthcare, human resource capacity, education, and proximity to cities were associated with increased effectiveness. Effectiveness of non-artemisinin-based drugs was much lower than that of artemisinin-based with no improvement over time: 52.3\% (17.9-74.9) for 1991-2000 and 55.5\% (27.1-73.4) for 2011-2015. Overall, AmE for artemisinin-based and non-artemisinin-based drugs were, respectively, 29.6 and 36\% below clinical efficacy as measured in anti-malarial drug trials. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that health system performance, drug quality and patient adherence influence the effectiveness of anti-malarials used in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria. These results provide guidance to countries' treatment practises and are critical inputs for malaria prevalence and incidence models used to estimate national level malaria burden.},

  abstract = {The efficacy of malaria control and elimination on islands may depend on the intensity of new parasite inflow. On the Comoros archipelago, where falciparum malaria remains a major public health problem because of spread of drug resistance and insufficient malaria control, recent interventions for malaria elimination were planned on Moheli, 1 of 4 islands in the Comoros archipelago. To assess the relevance of such a local strategy, we performed a population genetics analysis by using multilocus microsatellite and resistance genotyping of Plasmodium falciparum sampled from each island of the archipelago. We found a contrasted population genetic structure explained by geographic isolation, human migration, malaria transmission, and drug selective pressure. Our findings suggest that malaria elimination interventions should be implemented simultaneously on the entire archipelago rather than restricted to 1 island and demonstrate the necessity for specific chemoresistance surveillance on each of the 4 Comorian islands.},

  abstract = {Human malaria is a complex disease that can show a wide array of clinical outcomes, from asymptomatic carriage and chronic infection to acute disease presenting various life-threatening pathologies. The specific outcome of an infection is believed to be determined by a multifactorial interplay between the host and the parasite but with a general trend toward disease attenuation with increasing prior exposure. Therefore, the main burden of malaria in a population can be understood as a function of transmission intensity, which itself is intricately linked to the prevalence of infected hosts and mosquito vectors, the distribution of infection outcomes, and the parasite population diversity. Predicting the long-term impact of malaria intervention measures therefore requires an in-depth understanding of how the parasite causes disease, how this relates to previous exposures, and how different infection pathologies contribute to parasite transmission. Here, we provide a brief overview of recent advances in the molecular epidemiology of clinical malaria and how these might prove to be influential in our fight against this important disease.},

However, these techniques have not yet been applied to the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, in which a larger genome, slower generation times, and a complex life cycle make them difficult to implement. Here, we demonstrate the viability of de novo mutation studies in P. falciparum for the first time. Using a combination of sequencing, library preparation, and genotyping methods that have been optimized for accuracy in low-complexity genomic regions, we have detected de novo mutations that distinguish nominally identical parasites from clonal lineages. Despite its slower evolutionary rate compared with bacterial or viral species, de novo mutation can be detected in P. falciparum across timescales of just 1-2\,years and evolutionary rates in low-complexity regions of the genome can be up to twice that detected in the rest of the genome. The increased mutation rate allows the identification of separate clade expansions that cannot be found using previous genomic epidemiology approaches and could be a crucial tool for mapping residual transmission patterns in disease elimination campaigns and reintroduction scenarios.},

Using spatial genetic inference, we identify a potential signal of common dispersal patterns in the Anopheles gambiae and Plasmodium falciparum host-parasite system as seen through a between-species correlation of the differences between geographic sampling location and geographic location predicted from the genome. This correlation may be due to coupled dispersal dynamics between host and parasite but may also reflect statistical artifacts due to uneven spatial distribution of sampling locations. Using continuous-space population genetics simulations, we investigate the degree to which uneven distribution of sampling locations leads to bias in prediction of spatial location from genetic data and implement methods to counter this effect. We demonstrate that while algorithmic bias presents a problem in inference from spatio-genetic data, the correlation structure between A. gambiae and P. falciparum predictions cannot be attributed to spatial bias alone and is thus likely a genetic signal of co-dispersal in a host-parasite system.},

In the last phases of malaria elimination, as universal interventions reap diminishing marginal returns, national resources must become increasingly devoted to identifying where residual transmission is occurring. The needs for accurate measures of progress and practical advice about how to allocate scarce resources require new analytical methods to quantify fine-grained heterogeneity in malaria risk. Using routine national surveillance data from Swaziland (a sub-Saharan country on the verge of elimination), we estimated individual reproductive numbers. Fine-grained maps of reproductive numbers and local malaria importation rates were combined to show 'malariogenic potential', a first for malaria elimination. As countries approach elimination, these individual-based measures of transmission risk provide meaningful metrics for planning programmatic responses and prioritizing areas where interventions will contribute most to malaria elimination.},

  abstract = {Background Although Plasmodium falciparum transmission frequently exhibits seasonal patterns, the drivers of malaria seasonality are often unclear. Given the massive variation in the landscape upon which transmission acts, intra-annual fluctuations are likely influenced by different factors in different settings. Further, the presence of potentially substantial inter-annual variation can mask seasonal patterns; it may be that a location has “strongly seasonal” transmission and yet no single season ever matches the mean, or synoptic, curve. Accurate accounting of seasonality can inform efficient malaria control and treatment strategies. In spite of the demonstrable importance of accurately capturing the seasonality of malaria, data required to describe these patterns is not universally accessible and as such localized and regional efforts at quantifying malaria seasonality are disjointed and not easily generalized. Methods The purpose of this review was to audit the literature on seasonality of P. falciparum and quantitatively summarize the collective findings. Six search terms were selected to systematically compile a list of papers relevant to the seasonality of P. falciparum transmission, and a questionnaire was developed to catalogue the manuscripts. Results and discussion 152 manuscripts were identified as relating to the seasonality of malaria transmission, deaths due to malaria or the population dynamics of mosquito vectors of malaria. Among these, there were 126 statistical analyses and 31 mechanistic analyses (some manuscripts did both). Discussion Identified relationships between temporal patterns in malaria and climatological drivers of malaria varied greatly across the globe, with different drivers appearing important in different locations. Although commonly studied drivers of malaria such as temperature and rainfall were often found to significantly influence transmission, the lags between a weather event and a resulting change in malaria transmission also varied greatly by location. Conclusions The contradicting results of studies using similar data and modelling approaches from similar locations as well as the confounding nature of climatological covariates underlines the importance of a multi-faceted modelling approach that attempts to capture seasonal patterns at both small and large spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission originated in the early twentieth century to provide insights into how to most effectively combat malaria. The foundations of the Ross–Macdonald theory were established by 1970. Since then, there has been a growing interest in reducing the public health burden of mosquito-borne pathogens and an expanding use of models to guide their control. To assess how theory has changed to confront evolving public health challenges, we compiled a bibliography of 325 publications from 1970 through 2010 that included at least one mathematical model of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission and then used a 79-part questionnaire to classify each of 388 associated models according to its biological assumptions. As a composite measure to interpret the multidimensional results of our survey, we assigned a numerical value to each model that measured its similarity to 15 core assumptions of the Ross–Macdonald model. Although the analysis illustrated a growing acknowledgement of geographical, ecological and epidemiological complexities in modelling transmission, most models during the past 40 years closely resemble the Ross–Macdonald model. Modern theory would benefit from an expansion around the concepts of heterogeneous mosquito biting, poorly mixed mosquito-host encounters, spatial heterogeneity and temporal variation in the transmission process.},

The spatially defined focus, or nidus, of transmission may be characterized by vegetation as well as by climate, latitude, elevation, and geology. The ecological complexity, dimensions, and temporal stability of the nidus are determined largely by pathogen natural history and vector bionomics. Host populations, transmission efficiency, and therefore pathogen amplification vary spatially, thereby creating a heterogeneous surface that may be defined by remote sensing and statistical tools. The current review describes the evolution of landscape epidemiology as a science and exemplifies selected aspects by contrasting the ecology of two different recent disease outbreaks in North America caused by West Nile virus, an explosive, highly virulent mosquito-borne virus producing ephemeral nidi, and Borrelia burgdorferi, a slowly amplifying chronic pathogen producing semipermanent nidi.},

Its development has been facilitated by next-generation sequencing, which allows for screening thousands to millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms in many individuals and populations at reasonable costs. In parallel, data sets describing environmental factors have greatly improved and increasingly become publicly accessible. Accordingly, numerous analytical methods for environmental association studies have been developed. Environmental association analysis identifies genetic variants associated with particular environmental factors and has the potential to uncover adaptive patterns that are not discovered by traditional tests for the detection of outlier loci based on population genetic differentiation. We review methods for conducting environmental association analysis including categorical tests, logistic regressions, matrix correlations, general linear models and mixed effects models. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches, provide a list of dedicated software packages and their specific properties, and stress the importance of incorporating neutral genetic structure in the analysis. We also touch on additional important aspects such as sampling design, environmental data preparation, pooled and reduced-representation sequencing, candidate-gene approaches, linearity of allele-environment associations and the combination of environmental association analyses with traditional outlier detection tests. We conclude by summarizing expected future directions in the field, such as the extension of statistical approaches, environmental association analysis for ecological gene annotation, and the need for replication and post hoc validation studies.},

In Amazonia non-floodable swampy forests can not be easily distinguished from non-floodable terra-firme forests using just bidimensional spectral data. Accurate topographic data are required for the understanding of land surface processes at finer scales. Topographic detail has now become available with the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) data. This new digital elevation model (DEM) shows the feature-rich relief of lowland rain forests, adding to the ability to map rain forest environments through many quantitative terrain descriptors. In this paper we report on the development of a new quantitative topographic algorithm, called HAND (Height Above the Nearest Drainage), based on SRTM-DEM data. We tested the HAND descriptor for a groundwater, topographic and vegetation dataset from central Amazonia. The application of the HAND descriptor in terrain classification revealed strong correlation between soil water conditions, like classes of water table depth, and topography. This correlation obeys the physical principle of soil draining potential, or relative vertical distance to drainage, which can be detected remotely through the topography of the vegetation canopy found in the SRTM-DEM data. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

New applications, techniques and criticisms of techniques appear like clockwork with each new journal issue. The developments are an encouraging, and at times bewildering, sign of progress in an exciting new field of study. However, we suggest that the rapid expansion of landscape genetics has belied important flaws in the development of the field, and we add an air of caution to this breakneck pace of expansion. Specifically, landscape genetic studies often lose sight of the fundamental principles and complex consequences of gene flow, instead favoring simplistic interpretations and broad inferences not necessarily warranted by the data. Here, we describe common pitfalls that characterize such studies, and provide practical guidance to improve landscape genetic investigation, with careful consideration of inferential limits, scale, replication, and the ecological and evolutionary context of spatial genetic patterns. Ultimately, the utility of landscape genetics will depend on translating the relationship between gene flow and landscape features into an understanding of long-term population outcomes. We hope the perspective presented here will steer landscape genetics down a more scientifically sound and productive path, garnering a field that is as informative in the future as it is popular now This article is protected by copyright.

Dispersing animals can spread pathogens between infected areas and naïve populations. While tracking free-ranging animals over the geographic scales relevant to landscape-level disease management is challenging, landscape features that influence gene flow among wildlife populations may also influence the contact rates and disease spread between populations. We used spatial diffusion and barriers to white-tailed deer gene flow, identified through landscape genetics, to model the distribution of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in the infected region of southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois, USA. Our generalized linear model showed that risk of CWD infection declined exponentially with distance from current outbreaks, and inclusion of gene flow barriers dramatically improved fit and predictive power of the model. Our results indicate that CWD is spreading across the Midwestern landscape from these two endemic foci, but spread is strongly influenced by highways and rivers that also reduce deer gene flow. We used our model to plot a risk map, providing important information for CWD management by identifying likely routes of disease spread and providing a tool for prioritizing disease monitoring and containment efforts. The current analysis may serve as a framework for modeling future disease risk drawing on genetic information to investigate barriers to spread and extending management and monitoring beyond currently affected regions.},

Currently there is no commercial yield monitor available for avocado tree crops and the manual count method used for yield forecasting can be highly inaccurate. Remote sensing using satellite imagery offers a potential means to achieve accurate pre-harvest yield forecasting. This study evaluated the accuracies of high resolution WorldView (WV) 2 and 3 satellite imagery and targeted field sampling for the pre-harvest prediction of total fruit weight (kg·tree -1 ) and average fruit size (g) and for mapping the spatial distribution of these yield parameters across the orchard block. WV 2 satellite imagery was acquired over two avocado orchards during 2014, and WV3 imagery was acquired in 2016 and 2017 over these same two orchards plus an additional three orchards. Sample trees representing high, medium and low vigour zones were selected from normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the WV images and sampled for total fruit weight (kg·tree -1 ) and average fruit size (g) per tree. For each sample tree, spectral reflectance data was extracted from the eight band multispectral WV imagery and 18 vegetation indices (VIs) derived. Principal component analysis (PCA) and non-linear regression analysis was applied to each of the derived VIs to determine the index with the strongest relationship to the measured total fruit weight and average fruit size. For all trees measured over the three year period (2014, 2016, and 2017) a consistent positive relationship was identified between the VI using near infrared band one and the red edge band (RENDVI1) to both total fruit weight (kg·tree -1 ) (R 2 = 0.45, 0.28, and 0.29 respectively) and average fruit size (g) (R 2 = 0.56, 0.37, and 0.29 respectively) across all orchard blocks. Separate analysis of each orchard block produced higher R 2 values as well as identifying different optimal VIs for each orchard block and year. This suggests orchard location and growing season are influencing the relationship of spectral reflectance to total fruit weight and average fruit size. Classified maps of avocado yield (kg·tree -1 ) and average fruit size per tree (g) were produced using the relationships developed for each orchard block. Using the relationships derived between the measured yield parameters and the optimal VIs, total fruit yield (kg) was calculated for each of the five sampled blocks for the 2016 and 2017 seasons and compared to actual yield at time of harvest and pre-season grower estimates. Prediction accuracies achieved for each block far exceeded those provided by the grower estimates.},

We found evidence of a significant contribution of African and South Asian lineages to present-day New World malaria parasites with additional P. vivax lineages appearing to originate from Melanesia that were putatively carried by the Australasian peoples who contributed genes to Native Americans. Importantly, mitochondrial lineages of the P. vivax-like species P. simium are shared by platyrrhine monkeys and humans in the Atlantic Forest ecosystem, but not across the Amazon, which most likely resulted from one or a few recent human-to-monkey transfers. While enslaved Africans were likely the main carriers of P. falciparum mitochondrial lineages into the Americas after the conquest, additional parasites carried by Australasian peoples in pre-Columbian times may have contributed to the extensive diversity of extant local populations of P. vivax.},

More recently, several papers have investigated the effectiveness of these BMPs in protecting small urban watercourses, and have concluded that they do not. Investigations of both design practices and effectiveness reveals that there is a lot of ignorance in the scientific and engineering community about what constitutes a properly designed BMP and what it really achieves, with respect to environmental protection. This paper discusses the state-of-practice in BMP design in the United States and points out its strengths and weaknesses with respect to real protection of the downstream receiving water environment. The paper recommends an approach to design criteria development that can be applied over a wide variety of climatologic, topologic, and geologic conditions to protect receiving waters systems.},

Population and within-host diversity were used to characterize differences between imported and locally acquired infections. Logistic regression was used to assess the added value of diversity metrics to classify imported and local infections beyond epidemiology data alone.Parasite population in Eswatini was highly diverse (expected heterozygosity [HE] = 0.75) and complex: 67\% polyclonal infections, mean multiplicity of infection (MOI) 2.2, and mean within-host infection fixation index (FWS) 0.84. Imported cases had comparable diversity to local cases but exhibited higher MOI (2.4 vs 2.0; P = .004) and lower mean FWS (0.82 vs 0.85; P = .03). Addition of MOI and FWS to multivariate analyses did not increase discrimination between imported and local infections.In contrast to the common perception that P. falciparum diversity declines with decreasing transmission intensity, Eswatini isolates exhibited high parasite diversity consistent with high rates of malaria importation and limited local transmission. Estimates of malaria transmission intensity from genetic data need to consider the effect of importation, especially as countries near elimination.},

This made it clear that the research world is more disparate and, in some cases, such as in the Asia-Pacific region, more contradictory than we have seen. Previously identified observations, such as an increase in respondents' simultaneous membership of multiple societies, have been consolidated, whereas others, such as the demand for support from societies for high standards of publishing ethics, are new to this survey. Central to the survey's findings is the continuing rise in researcher demand for open access and open research as tools for both consumption and production of research. Ultimately, by using these findings, this article suggests some strategies to enable societies to navigate their way through this new and constantly evolving world of academic research.},

  abstract = {Malaria, mostly due to Plasmodium falciparum infection in Africa, remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. Standard treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria is artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), which includes a rapid-acting artemisinin derivative plus a longer-acting partner drug, and standard therapy for severe P. falciparum malaria is intravenous artesunate. The efficacy of artemisinins and ACT has been threatened by the emergence of artemisinin partial resistance in Southeast Asia, mediated principally by mutations in the P. falciparum Kelch 13 (K13) protein. High ACT treatment failure rates have occurred when resistance to partner drugs is also seen. Recently, artemisinin partial resistance has emerged in Rwanda, Uganda and the Horn of Africa, with independent emergences of different K13 mutants in each region. In this Review, we summarize our current knowledge of artemisinin partial resistance and focus on the emergence of resistance in Africa, including its epidemiology, transmission dynamics and mechanisms. At present, the clinical impact of emerging resistance in Africa is unclear and most available evidence suggests that the efficacies of leading ACTs remain excellent, but there is an urgent need to better appreciate the extent of the problem and its consequences for the treatment and control of malaria.},

  abstract = {Background With limited resources and spatio-temporal heterogeneity of malaria in developing countries, it is still difficult to assess the real impact of socioeconomic and environmental factors in order to set up targeted campaigns against malaria at an accurate scale. Our goal was to detect malaria hotspots in rural area and assess the extent to which household socioeconomic status and meteorological recordings may explain the occurrence and evolution of these hotspots. Methods Data on malaria cases from 2010 to 2014 and on socioeconomic and meteorological factors were acquired from four health facilities within the Nanoro demographic surveillance area. Statistical cross correlation was used to quantify the temporal association between weekly malaria incidence and meteorological factors. Local spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed and restricted to each transmission period using Kulldorff’s elliptic spatial scan statistic. Univariate and multivariable analysis were used to assess the principal socioeconomic and meteorological determinants of malaria hotspots using a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) approach. Results Rainfall and temperature were positively and significantly associated with malaria incidence, with a lag time of 9 and 14\,weeks, respectively. Spatial analysis showed a spatial autocorrelation of malaria incidence and significant hotspots which was relatively stable throughout the study period. Furthermore, low socioeconomic status households were strongly associated with malaria hotspots (aOR\,=\,1.21, 95\% confidence interval: 1.03–1.40). Conclusion These fine-scale findings highlight a relatively stable spatio-temporal pattern of malaria risk and indicate that social and environmental factors play an important role in malaria incidence. Integrating data on these factors into existing malaria struggle tools would help in the development of sustainable bottleneck strategies adapted to the local context for malaria control.},

  abstract = {Individual-level geographic information about malaria cases, such as the GPS coordinates of residence or health facility, is often collected as part of surveillance in near-elimination settings, but could be more effectively utilised to infer transmission dynamics, in conjunction with additional information such as symptom onset time and genetic distance. However, in the absence of data about the flow of parasites between populations, the spatial scale of malaria transmission is often not clear. As a result, it is important to understand the impact of varying assumptions about the spatial scale of transmission on key metrics of malaria transmission, such as reproduction numbers. We developed a method which allows the flexible integration of distance metrics (such as Euclidian distance, genetic distance or accessibility matrices) with temporal information into a single inference framework to infer malaria reproduction numbers. Twelve scenarios were defined, representing different assumptions about the likelihood of transmission occurring over different geographic distances and likelihood of missing infections (as well as high and low amounts of uncertainty in this estimate). These scenarios were applied to four individual level datasets from malaria eliminating contexts to estimate individual reproduction numbers and how they varied over space and time. Model comparison suggested that including spatial information improved models as measured by second order AIC (ΔAICc), compared to time only results. Across scenarios and across datasets, including spatial information tended to increase the seasonality of temporal patterns in reproduction numbers and reduced noise in the temporal distribution of reproduction numbers. The best performing parameterisations assumed long-range transmission ({$>$}\,200~km) was possible. Our approach is flexible and provides the potential to incorporate other sources of information which can be converted into distance or adjacency matrices such as travel times or molecular markers.},

Tools to efficiently monitor drug resistance beyond resource-demanding therapeutic efficacy studies are necessary. A custom multiplex amplicon sequencing assay based on Illumina technology was designed to target the marker of partial resistance to artemisinin (K13), five candidate modulators of artemisinin resistance, the marker of resistance to chloroquine (crt), and four neutral microsatellite loci. The assay was used to genotype 635 P. falciparum-positive blood samples collected across seven provinces of Vietnam and one of Cambodia between 2000 and 2016. Markers of resistance to artemisinin partner-drugs piperaquine (copy number of plasmepsin-2) and mefloquine (copy number of multidrug-resistance 1) were determined by qPCR. Parasite population structure was further assessed using a 101-SNP barcode. Validated mutations of artemisinin partial resistance in K13 were found in 48.1\% of samples, first detection was in 2000, and by 2015 prevalence overcame\,{$>$}\,50\% in Central Highlands and Binh Phuoc province. K13-C580Y variant became predominant country-wide, quickly replacing an outbreak of K13-I543T in Central Highlands. Mutations in candidate artemisinin resistance modulator genes paralleled the trends of K13 mutants, whereas resistance to piperaquine and mefloquine remained low (≈ 10\%) by 2015-2016.

  abstract = {At over 40 years, the Landsat satellites provide the longest temporal record of space-based land surface observations, and the successful 2013 launch of the Landsat-8 is continuing this legacy. Ideally, the Landsat data record should be consistent over the Landsat sensor series. The Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has improved calibration, signal to noise characteristics, higher 12-bit radiometric resolution, and spectrally narrower wavebands than the previous Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +). Reflective wavelength differences between the two Landsat sensors depend also on the surface reflectance and atmospheric state which are difficult to model comprehensively. The orbit and sensing geometries of the Landsat-8 OLI and Landsat-7 ETM + provide swath edge overlapping paths sensed only one day apart. The overlap regions are sensed in alternating backscatter and forward scattering orientations so Landsat bi-directional reflectance effects are evident but approximately balanced between the two sensors when large amounts of time series data are considered. Taking advantage of this configuration a total of 59 million 30 m corresponding sensor observations extracted from 6317 Landsat-7 ETM + and Landsat-8 OLI images acquired over three winter and three summer months for all the conterminous United States (CONUS) are compared. Results considering different stages of cloud and saturation filtering, and filtering to reduce one day surface state differences, demonstrate the importance of appropriate per-pixel data screening. Top of atmosphere (TOA) and atmospherically corrected surface reflectance for the spectrally corresponding visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared bands, and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are compared and their differences quantified. On average the OLI TOA reflectance is greater than the ETM + TOA reflectance for all bands, with greatest differences in the near-infrared (NIR) and the shortwave infrared bands due to the quite different spectral response functions between the sensors. The atmospheric correction reduces the mean difference in the NIR and shortwave infrared but increases the mean difference in the visible bands. Regardless of whether TOA or surface reflectance are used to generate NDVI, on average, for vegetated soil and vegetation surfaces (0 ≤ NDVI ≤ 1), the OLI NDVI is greater than the ETM + NDVI. Statistical functions to transform between the comparable sensor bands and sensor NDVI values are presented so that the user community may apply them in their own research to improve temporal continuity between the Landsat-7 ETM + and Landsat-8 OLI sensor data. The transformation functions were developed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and were fit quite reliably (r2 values {$>$} 0.7 for the reflectance data and {$>$} 0.9 for the NDVI data, p-values {$<$} 0.0001).},

  abstract = {In urban and suburban areas, stormwater runoff is a primary stressor on surface waters. Conventional urban stormwater drainage systems often route runoff directly to streams and rivers, thus exacerbating pollutant inputs and hydrologic disturbance, and resulting in the degradation of ecosystem structure and function. Decentralized stormwater management tools, such as low impact development (LID) or water sensitive urban design (WSUD), may offer a more sustainable solution to stormwater management if implemented at a watershed scale. These tools are designed to pond, infiltrate, and harvest water at the source, encouraging evaporation, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and re-use of stormwater. While there are numerous demonstrations of WSUD practices, there are few examples of widespread implementation at a watershed scale with the explicit objective of protecting or restoring a receiving stream. This article identifies seven major impediments to sustainable urban stormwater management: (1) uncertainties in performance and cost, (2) insufficient engineering standards and guidelines, (3) fragmented responsibilities, (4) lack of institutional capacity, (5) lack of legislative mandate, (6) lack of funding and effective market incentives, and (7) resistance to change. By comparing experiences from Australia and the United States, two developed countries with existing conventional stormwater infrastructure and escalating stream ecosystem degradation, we highlight challenges facing sustainable urban stormwater management and offer several examples of successful, regional WSUD implementation. We conclude by identifying solutions to each of the seven impediments that, when employed separately or in combination, should encourage widespread implementation of WSUD with watershed-based goals to protect human health and safety, and stream ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Citrus leprosis complex is an emerging disease in the Americas, associated with two unrelated taxa of viruses distributed in South, Central, and North America. The cytoplasmic viruses are Citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C), Citrus leprosis virus C2 (CiLV-C2), and Hibiscus green spot virus 2, and the nuclear viruses are Citrus leprosis virus N (CiLV-N) and Citrus necrotic spot virus. These viruses cause local lesion infections in all known hosts, with no natural systemic host identified to date. All leprosis viruses were believed to be transmitted by one species of mite, Brevipalpus phoenicis. However, mites collected from CiLV-C and CiLV-N infected citrus groves in Mexico were identified as B. yothersi and B. californicus sensu lato, respectively, and only B. yothersi was detected from CiLV-C2 and CiLV-N mixed infections in the Orinoco regions of Colombia. Phylogenetic analysis of the helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 domains and p24 gene amino acid sequences of cytoplasmic leprosis viruses showed a close relationship with recently deposited mosquito-borne negevirus sequences. Here, we present evidence that both cytoplasmic and nuclear viruses seem to replicate in viruliferous Brevipalpus species. The possible replication in the mite vector and the close relationship with mosquito borne negeviruses are consistent with the concept that members of the genus Cilevirus and Higrevirus originated in mites and citrus may play the role of mite virus vector.},

  abstract = {Humans move frequently and tend to carry parasites among areas with endemic malaria and into areas where local transmission is unsustainable. Human-mediated parasite mobility can thus sustain parasite populations in areas where they would otherwise be absent. Data describing human mobility and malaria epidemiology can help classify landscapes into parasite demographic sources and sinks, ecological concepts that have parallels in malaria control discussions of transmission foci. By linking transmission to parasite flow, it is possible to stratify landscapes for malaria control and elimination, as sources are disproportionately important to the regional persistence of malaria parasites. Here, we identify putative malaria sources and sinks for pre-elimination Namibia using malaria parasite rate (PR) maps and call data records from mobile phones, using a steady-state analysis of a malaria transmission model to infer where infections most likely occurred. We also examined how the landscape of transmission and burden changed from the pre-elimination setting by comparing the location and extent of predicted pre-elimination transmission foci with modeled incidence for 2009. This comparison suggests that while transmission was spatially focal pre-elimination, the spatial distribution of cases changed as burden declined. The changing spatial distribution of burden could be due to importation, with cases focused around importation hotspots, or due to heterogeneous application of elimination effort. While this framework is an important step towards understanding progressive changes in malaria distribution and the role of subnational transmission dynamics in a policy-relevant way, future work should account for international parasite movement, utilize real time surveillance data, and relax the steady state assumption required by the presented model.},

Under future climate projections, we predicted a modest increase in the overall area suitable for malaria transmission, but a net decrease in the most suitable area. Combined with human population density projections, our maps suggest that areas with temperatures suitable for year-round, highest-risk transmission will shift from coastal West Africa to the Albertine Rift between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, whereas areas with seasonal transmission suitability will shift toward sub-Saharan coastal areas. Mapping temperature suitability places important bounds on malaria transmissibility and, along with local level demographic, socioeconomic, and ecological factors, can indicate where resources may be best spent on malaria control.},

Field surveys for interpreting the estimates derived from the remote-sensing analyses were conducted in June and September 2007. From 2000 to 2006, there has been rapid expansion of inland aquaculture, especially shrimp farming, in the western part of the Bac Lieu province and the coastal regions of both the Bac Lieu and Soc Trang provinces. The triple rice-cropped area expanded concentrically from specific small locations in the Bac Lieu province from 2001 to 2006. The triple rice-cropped areas in Soc Trang province also expanded concentrically from 2001 to 2003, but some of these new triple rice-cropped areas returned to double rice cropping after 2004. Interviews with farmers and ancillary hydrological monitoring data suggested that changes in the water environment and transmission of information about new farming systems are closely connected with the annual expansion of triple rice-cropped areas in both provinces. The availability of salt-free irrigation water in the dry season may have led some pioneering farmers to attempt full-scale dry-season cropping. Furthermore, successful dry-season harvests and recent increases in the price of rice might have encouraged neighboring farmers to follow suit. Based on MODIS time-series imagery with field interviews at land-use change hotspots, the spatial structure of coastal farming systems and their recent changes were revealed from a macroscopic view point. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This paper presents the methodology used to detect temporal changes in the extent of annual flooding within the Cambodia and the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) based on MODIS time-series imagery (Wavelet-based Filter for detecting spatio-temporal changes in Flood Inundation; WFFI). This methodology involves the use of a wavelet-based filter to interpolate missing information and reduce the noise component in the time-series data, as proposed in a previous study. The smoothed time profiles of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), and the Difference Value between EVI and LSWI (DVEL) are obtained from MOD09 8-day composite time-series data (resolution: 500??m; time period: 2000-2005). The proposed algorithm was applied to produce time-series inundation maps (WFFI products) for the five annual flood seasons over the period from 2000 to 2004. The WFFI products were validated via comparisons with Landsat-derived results and inundation maps based on RADARSAT images, hydrological data, and digital elevation model data. Compared with the RADARSAT-derived inundation maps at the province level, the obtained RMSE range from 364 to 443??km2 and the determination coefficients [R2] range from 0.89 to 0.92. Compared with Landsat-derived results at the 10-km grid level, the obtained RMSE range from 6.8 to 15.2??km2 and the determination coefficients [R2] range from 0.77 to 0.97. The inundated area of flooded forests/marsh to the northeast of Tonle Sap Lake were underestimated, probably because of extensive vegetation cover in this area. The spatial characteristics of the estimated start dates, end dates, and duration of inundation cycles were also determined for the period from 2000 to 2004. There are clear contrasts in the distribution of the estimated end dates and duration of inundation cycles between large-scale floods (2000-2002) and medium- and small-scale floods (2003 and 2004). At the regional scale, the estimated start dates for the southern part of An Giang Province during 2003 and 2004 was distinctly later than that for surrounding areas. The results indicate that these triple-cropping areas enclosed by dikes increased in extent from 2003 to 2004. In contrast, the estimated end dates of inundation at the Co Do and Song Hau State Farms were clearly earlier than those for surrounding areas, although the estimated start dates were similar. Temporal changes in the inundation area of Flood pixels in the Dong Thap and Long An Provinces are in excellent agreement with daily water-level data recorded at Tan Chau Station. The estimated area of Long-term water body increased in size from 2000 to 2004, especially in coastal areas of the Ca Mau and Bac Lieu Provinces. Statistical data for Vietnam indicate that this trend may reflect the expansion of shrimp-farming areas. The WFFI products enable an understanding of seasonal and annual changes in the water distribution and environment of the Cambodia and the VMD from a global viewpoint. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey of 1354 healthy children and adults in three communities in western Kenya across a gradient of malaria transmission (Ajigo, Webuye, and Kapsisywa-Kipsamoite), asymptomatic P. falciparum infections were screened by rapid diagnostic tests, blood smear, and quantitative PCR of dried blood spots targeting the varATS gene in genomic DNA. A multiplex quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR assay targeting female and male gametocyte genes (pfs25, pfs230p), a gene with a transcriptional pattern restricted to asexual blood stages (piesp2), and human GAPDH was also developed to determine total parasite and gametocyte densities among parasitaemic individuals. RESULTS: The prevalence of varATS-detectable asymptomatic infections was greatest in Ajigo (42\%), followed by Webuye (10\%). Only two infections were detected in Kapsisywa. No infections were detected in Kipsamoite. Across all communities, children aged 11-15~years account for the greatest proportion total and sub-microscopic asymptomatic infections. In younger age groups, the majority of infections were detectable by microscopy, while 68\% of asymptomatically infected adults ({$>$}\,21~years old) had sub-microscopic parasitaemia. Piesp2-derived parasite densities correlated poorly with microscopy-determined parasite densities in patent infections relative to varATS-based detection. In general, both male and female gametocytaemia increased with increasing varATS-derived total parasitaemia. A substantial proportion (41.7\%) of individuals with potential for onward transmission had qPCR-estimated parasite densities below the limit of microscopic detection, but above the detectable limit of varATS qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: This assessment of parasitaemia and gametocytaemia in three communities with different transmission intensities revealed evidence of a substantial sub-patent infectious reservoir among asymptomatic carriers of P. falciparum. Experimental studies are needed to definitively determine whether the low-density infections in communities such as Ajigo and Webuye contribute significantly to malaria transmission.},

  abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing technologies are being increasingly applied to Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates to identify genetic determinants of malaria pathogenesis. However, genome-wide discovery methods, such as haplotype scans for signatures of natural selection, are hindered by missing genotypes in sequence data. Poor correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P. falciparum genome complicates efforts to apply established missing-genotype imputation methods that leverage off patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD). The accuracy of state-of-the-art, LD-based imputation methods (IMPUTE, Beagle) was assessed by measuring allelic r2 for 459 P. falciparum samples from malaria patients in 4 countries: Thailand, Cambodia, Gambia, and Malawi. In restricting our analysis to 86 k high-quality SNPs across the populations, we found that the complete-case analysis was restricted to 21k SNPs (24.5\%), despite no single SNP having more than 10\% missing genotypes. The accuracy of Beagle in filling in missing genotypes was consistently high across all populations (allelic r2, 0.87-0.96), but the performance of IMPUTE was mixed (allelic r2, 0.34-0.99) depending on reference haplotypes and population. Positive selection analysis using Beagle-imputed haplotypes identified loci involved in resistance to chloroquine (crt) in Thailand, Cambodia, and Gambia, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (dhfr, dhps) in Cambodia, and artemisinin (kelch13) in Cambodia. Tajima's D-based analysis identified genes under balancing selection that encode well-characterized vaccine candidates: apical merozoite antigen 1 (ama1) and merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1). In contrast, the complete-case analysis failed to identify any well-validated drug resistance or candidate vaccine loci, except kelch13. In a setting of low LD and modest levels of missing genotypes, using Beagle to impute P. falciparum genotypes is a viable strategy for conducting accurate large-scale population genetics and association analyses, and supporting global surveillance for drug resistance markers and candidate vaccine antigens.},

With more than 90\% of the malaria cases in this region caused by Plasmodium vivax, an efficient national/regional elimination plan must include a comprehensive study of this parasite's genetic diversity. Here, we retrospectively analyzed P. vivax genetic diversity in autochthonous and imported field isolates collected in different endemic regions in Panama from 2007 to 2020, using highly polymorphic markers (csp, msp-1, and msp-3α). We did the analysis using molecular techniques that are cost-effective for malaria molecular surveillance within Mesoamerica. Thus, we used molecular analyses that are feasible for malaria molecular surveillance within the region, and that can provide useful information for policy and decision making about malaria elimination. We also evaluated if haplotypes established by combining the genotypes found in these genes were associated with relevant epidemiological variables and showed structure across the transmission foci that have been observed in Panama. Ten different haplotypes were identified, some of them strongly associated with geographical origin, age, and collection year. Phylogenetic analysis of csp (central repeat domain) revealed that both major variant types (vk210 and vk247) were circulating in Panama. Variant vk247 was restricted to the eastern endemic regions, while vk210 was predominant (77.3\%) and widespread, displaying higher diversity (14 alleles) and geographically biased alleles. The regional implications of these molecular findings for the control of P. vivax malaria to achieve elimination across Mesoamerica are discussed.},

The analysis is based on 1097 samples collected at health facilities during passive malaria case detection in 2019; it provides a baseline for analyzing parasite genetic metrics as they vary over time and geographic space. The study's goal was to identify genetic metrics that were informative about transmission intensity and other aspects of transmission dynamics, focusing on measures of genetic relatedness between parasites. We found the best genetic proxy for local malaria incidence to be the proportion of polygenomic infections (those with multiple genetically distinct parasites), although this relationship broke down at low incidence. The proportion of related parasites was less correlated with incidence while local genetic diversity was uninformative. The type of relatedness could discriminate local transmission patterns: two nearby areas had similarly high fractions of relatives, but one was dominated by clones and the other by outcrossed relatives. Throughout Senegal, 58\% of related parasites belonged to a single network of relatives, within which parasites were enriched for shared haplotypes at known and suspected drug resistance loci and at one novel locus, reflective of ongoing selection pressure.},

The motivation is that evolutionary inferences are often made from phylogenetic trees reconstructed from population data even though recombination may well occur (mtDNA or viral sequences) or does occur (nuclear sequences). We investigate the size and direction of biases when a single tree is reconstructed ignoring recombination. Standard software (PHYLIP) was used to construct the best phylogenetic tree from sequences simulated under the coalescent with recombination. With recombination present, the length of terminal branches and the total branch length are larger, and the time to the most recent common ancestor smaller, than for a tree reconstructed from sequences evolving with no recombination. The effects are pronounced even for small levels of recombination that may not be immediately detectable in a data set. The phylogenies when recombination is present superficially resemble phylogenies for sequences from an exponentially growing population. However, exponential growth has a different effect on statistics such as Tajima's D. Furthermore, ignoring recombination leads to a large overestimation of the substitution rate heterogeneity and the loss of the molecular clock. These results are discussed in relation to viral and mtDNA data sets.},

The main peat-accumulating species of these soligenous peatlands are the Juncaceae Distichia muscoides and Oxychloe andina, which are adapted to the harsh environmental conditions at these altitudes. The cushion peatlands are of significant importance for the local human population. They represent pastureland and are important water reservoirs. Increasing grazing intensity in the highlands, mostly by hoofed animals, endanger these sensitive eco-systems, resulting in erosion and destruction of the peat deposits. The loss of the protective vegetation cover within the water catchment areas due to dry periods and/or overgrazing, leads to an increased input of sedi- ment and the expansion of alluvial fans upon the peat deposits. In the past, the peatlands recovered from these short-term perturbations. Sediment layers were rapidly accumulated by the peat-forming vegetation. Only if there is heavy degradation of the vegetation cover, coupled with increased dis- charge, the peat deposits become susceptible to erosion and incision. If these processes continue in the future, the high-mountainous ecosystems will lose their unique water storing and regulating capacity.},

  abstract = {Arboviruses are a grade of viruses carried by arthropods, which have been in the headlines due to recent epidemics. Members of this grade are the families Flaviviridae which includes Zika (ZIKV), Dengue (DENV), Yellow Fever (YFV), among other viruses and Togaviridae, which includes Chikungunya (CHIKV). Research on some arboviruses has been strong over the past couple of decades. Other arboviruses have not garnered much attention until lately. For example, ZIKV has been understudied until 2015. Since the 1950s ZIKV was considered to cause only a benign infection in humans. ZIKV became well studied only after the recent outbreaks of the virus in the Pacific, Americas, and South-East Asia, was found to be related to severe neuropathology, which includes the development of neurological defects such as microcephaly on the fetus and Guillain Barré Syndrome in adults. CHIKV is another arbovirus that although been circulating for a long time in Africa and Asia, has been recently introduced into the Americas in 2013, causing recurring outbreaks in South and Central American naïve populations. YFV, which been known to be endemic and thought to be controlled in South America, has re-emerged in Brazil beginning in December 2016. This outbreak, although restricted to transmission by the sylvatic mosquito Haemagogus leococelaenus, raised questions among researchers regarding the potential for spread to the United States due to the presence of the urban vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus\vphantom\{\} and a naïve, largely unvaccinated population. Another question that still remains is whether YFV will ever reach the Asian continent? Today, the time it takes for awareness of the health organizations, to convince the funding agencies, and to work on vaccine development is much more than the time needed for the disease to change from a local outbreak to a global epidemic. The overall objective of this work is to provide the grounds for a viral surveillance system based on evolution, utilizing the current ZIKV and CHIKV outbreaks and other arboviruses as case studies. Utilizing phylogenetic and molecular sequence alignment tools I developed a pipeline to evaluate the genomic changes of viruses on CHIKV and ZIKV. I also created a pipeline to generate pathogen transmission networks and compare different disease networks utilizing different network centrality metrics. CHIKV, DENV, YFV and ZIKV were utilized as case studies. The strategies utilized in this work will enable better abatement and management strategies of viral outbreaks. My findings indicate that changes in the coding sequence does not seem to be the main reason why ZIKV has changed its behavior in terms of pathogenicity. In CHIKV there is an insertion on the UTR region of a group of sequences and change of virulence has been associated with UTR sizes in different CHIKV strains. Upon analyzing viral 3' and 5' UTRs, a trinuncleotide motif, known as Musashi Binding Element was identified in both CHIKV and ZIKV, its presence and availability on ZIKV may explain a preference to human cells, in CHIKV the motif is present but not available. Although both CHIKV and ZIKV coexist and have spread in the same regions in a short period of time, their spread seems to be from independent events. When looking at transmission networks, there is a high correlation between the different centrality metrics utilized to measure all four DENV serotypes transmission networks, CHIKV, YFV and ZIKV have lower correlation, thus, distinct patterns.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The ongoing and severe public health threat of viruses of the family \mkbibemph{Flaviviridae}, including dengue, hepatitis C, West Nile, yellow fever, and zika, demand a greater understanding of how these viruses evolve, emerge and spread in order to respond. Central to this understanding is an updated phylogeny of the entire family. Unfortunately, most cladograms of \mkbibemph{Flaviviridae} focus on specific lineages, ignore outgroups, and rely on midpoint rooting, hampering their ability to test ingroup monophyly and estimate ingroup relationships. This problem is partly due to the lack of fully annotated genomes of \mkbibemph{Flaviviridae}, which has genera with slightly different gene content, hindering genome analysis without partitioning. To tackle these problems, we developed an annotation pipeline for \mkbibemph{Flaviviridae} that uses a combination of \mkbibemph{ab initio} and homology-based strategies. The pipeline recovered 100\% of the genes in reference genomes and annotated over 97\% of the expected genes in the remaining non curated sequences. We further demonstrate that the combined analysis of genomes of all genera of \mkbibemph{Flaviviridae} (\mkbibemph{Flavivirus, Hepacivirus, Pegivirus}, and \mkbibemph{Pestivirus}), as made possible by our annotation strategy, enhances the phylogenetic analyses of these viruses for all optimality criteria that we tested (parsimony, maximum likelihood, and posterior probability). The final tree sheds light on the phylogenetic relationship of viruses that are divergent from most \mkbibemph{Flaviviridae} and should be reclassified, especially the soybean cyst nematode virus 5 (SbCNV-5) and the Tamana bat virus. We also corroborate the close phylogenetic relationship of dengue and zika viruses with an unprecedented degree of support.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The presence of multiple genetically different pathogenic variants within the same individual host is common in infectious diseases. Although this is neglected in some diseases, it is well recognized in others like malaria, where it is typically referred to as multiplicity of infection (MOI) or complexity of infection (COI). In malaria, with the advent of molecular surveillance, data is increasingly being available with enough resolution to capture MOI and integrate it into molecular surveillance strategies. The distribution of MOI on the population level scales with transmission intensities, while MOI on the individual level is a confounding factor when monitoring haplotypes of particular interests, e.g., those associated with drug-resistance. Particularly, in high-transmission areas, MOI leads to a discrepancy between the likelihood of a haplotype being observed in an infection (prevalence) and its abundance in the pathogen population (frequency). Despite its importance, MOI is not universally defined. Competing definitions vary from verbal ones to those based on concise statistical frameworks. Heuristic approaches to MOI are popular, although they do not mine the full potential of available data and are typically biased, potentially leading to misinferences. We introduce a formal statistical framework and suggest a concise definition of MOI and its distribution on the host-population level. We show how it relates to alternative definitions such as the number of distinct haplotypes within an infection or the maximum number of alleles detectable across a set of genetic markers. It is shown how alternatives can be derived from the general framework. Different statistical methods to estimate the distribution of MOI and pathogenic variants at the population level are discussed. The estimates can be used as plug-ins to reconstruct the most probable MOI of an infection and set of infecting haplotypes in individual infections. Furthermore, the relation between prevalence of pathogenic variants and their frequency (relative abundance) in the pathogen population in the context of MOI is clarified, with particular regard to seasonality in transmission intensities. The framework introduced here helps to guide the correct interpretation of results emerging from different definitions of MOI. Especially, it excels comparisons between studies based on different analytical methods.},

  abstract = {The sustained climate change is going to modify the geographic distribution, the seasonal transmission gate and the intensity of the transmission of vector-borne diseases such as malaria or the bluetongue disease. These diseases occur nowadays at higher latitudes or altitudes. A further rise in ambient temperature and rainfall will extend the duration of the season in which mosquito vectors are transmitting pathogens. The parasites transmitted by the vectors also benefit from increasing temperatures, as both their reproduction and development are then accelerated, too. Thus, it seemed prudent to examine potential effects on the seasonal transmission gate due to the ongoing and predicted climate changes. Lower Saxony (northwest Germany) is a former malaria region with highest incidences of Anopheles atroparvus and tertian malaria along the coastal zones before malaria had finally become extinct in the early 1950s. Nevertheless, the Anopheles mosquitoes which transmit the malaria pathogens have still been present in Lower Saxony up to now. This together with the climate change-related implications gave reason to investigate whether a new autochthonous transmission could take place if the malaria pathogen is introduced again in Lower Saxony. Thus, the potential spatial and temporal structure of temperature-driven malaria transmissions was mapped using the basic reproduction rate (R (0)) and measured and predicted air temperatures (1947-1960, 1961-1990, 1985-2004, 2020, 2060, 2100, each best case and worst case scenario). This paper focuses on both the summarizing of the results from this risk modelling approach and on the conclusions to be drawn. The recommendations highlight the need to link vector monitoring as one of the key elements of an epidemiological monitoring with the environmental monitoring.},

  abstract = {Aim Frost is among the most dramatic stresses a plant can experience, and complex physiological adaptations are needed to endure long periods of sub-zero temperatures. Owing to the need to evolve these complex adaptations, transitioning from tropical to temperate climates is regarded as difficult. Here, we study the transition from tropical to temperate climates in the grass subfamily Pooideae, which dominates cool temperate, continental and Arctic regions. We produce a dated phylogeny and investigate the role of climate cooling in diversification. Location Global, temperate regions. Time period Cretaceous–Cenozoic. Major taxa Pooideae. Methods Using newly available fossils and methods, we dated a comprehensive Pooideae phylogeny and tested for the impact of palaeoclimates on diversification rates. Using ancestral state reconstruction, we investigated whether Pooideae ancestors experienced frost and winter. To locate the ancestral distribution area of Pooideae, we performed biogeographical analyses. Results We estimated a Late Cretaceous/early Palaeocene origin of the Pooideae (61–77 Ma), with all major clades already having diversified at the Eocene–Oligocene climate cooling (34 Ma). Climate cooling was a probable driving force of Pooideae diversification. Pooideae probably evolved in a temperate niche experiencing frost, but not long winters. Main conclusion Pooideae probably originated in a temperate niche and experienced cold temperatures and frost long before expansion of temperate biomes after the Eocene–Oligocene transition. This suggests that the Pooideae ancestor had adaptations to temperate climate and that certain responses to low-temperature stress are shared in extant Pooideae grasses. Throughout the Cenozoic, falling temperatures and expansion of temperate biomes were associated with an increase in diversification. However, complex mechanisms for enduring strongly seasonal climate with long, cold winters most probably evolved independently in daughter lineages. Our findings provide insight into how adaptations to historical changes in chill and frost exposure influence the distribution of plant diversity today.},

Groundwater temperatures may be measured along the cables with high spatial and tem- poral resolution using a Distributed Temperature Sensing system. The cables may be inserted up to depths of tens of meters in unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers. The main advantages of the method are that the cables are in direct contact with the aquifer material, the disturbance of the aquifer is minor, and no bore- hole is needed. This cost-effective approach may be applied to both passive and active heat tracer experi- ments. An active heat tracer experiment was conducted to estimate horizontal groundwater velocities in a managed aquifer recharge system in the Netherlands. Six fiber optic cables and a separate heating cable were inserted with a 1m spacing at the surface. The heating cable was turned on for 4 days and tempera- tures were measured during both heating and cooling of the aquifer. Temperature measurements at the heating cable alone were used to estimate the magnitude of the groundwater velocity and the thermal con- ductivity of the solids. The direction of the velocity and heat capacity of the solids were estimated by includ- ing temperature measurements at the other fiber optic cables in the analysis. The latter analysis suffered from the fact that the cables were not inserted exactly vertical. The three-dimensional position of the fiber optic cables must be measured for future active heat tracer experiments.},

  abstract = {Agricultural intensification and efficient use and targeting of fertilizer inputs on smallholder farms is key to sustainably improve food security. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how high-resolution satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images can be used to assess the spatial variability of yield, and yield response to fertilizer. The study included 48 and 50 smallholder fields monitored during the 2014 and 2015 cropping seasons south-east of Koutiala (Mali), cropped with the five major crops grown in the area (cotton, maize, sorghum, millet and peanuts). Each field included up to five plots with different fertilizer applications and one plot with farmer practice. Fortnightly, in-situ in each field data were collected synchronous with UAV imaging using a Canon S110 NIR camera. A concurrent series of very high-resolution satellite images was procured and these images were used to mask out trees. For each plot, we calculated vegetation index means, medians and coefficients of variation. Cross-validated general linear models were used to assess the predictability of relative differences in crop yield and yield response to fertilizer, explicitly accounting for the effects of fertility treatments, between-field and within-field variabilities. Differences between fields accounted for a much larger component of variation than differences between fertilization treatments. Vegetation indices from UAV images strongly related to ground cover (R2= 0.85), light interception (R2= 0.79) and vegetation indices derived from satellite images (R2values of about 0.8). Within-plot distributions of UAV-derived vegetation index values were negatively skewed, and within-plot variability of vegetation index values was negatively correlated with yield. Plots on shallow soils with poor growing conditions showed the largest within-plot variability. GLM models including UAV derived estimates of light interception explained up to 78\% of the variation in crop yield and 74\% of the variation in fertilizer response within a single field. These numbers dropped to about 45\% of the variation in yield and about 48\% of the variation in fertilizer response when lumping all fields of a given crop, with Q2values of respectively 22 and 40\% respectively when tested with a leave-field-out procedure. This indicates that remotely sensed imagery doesn't fully capture the influence of crop stress and management. Assessment of crop fertilizer responses with vegetation indices therefore needs a reference under similar management. Spatial variability in UAV-derived vegetation index values at the plot scale was significantly related to differences in yields and fertilizer responses. The strong relationships between light interception and ground cover indicate that combining vertical photographs or high-resolution remotely sensed vegetation indices with crop growth models allows to explicitly account for the spatial variability and will improve the accuracy of yield and crop production assessments, especially in heterogeneous smallholder conditions.},

  abstract = {The malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax differ in key biological processes and associated clinical effects, but consequences on population-level transmission dynamics are difficult to predict. This co-endemic malaria study from Guyana details important epidemiological contrasts between the species by coupling population genomics (1396 spatiotemporally matched parasite genomes, primarily from 2020-21) with sociodemographic analysis (nationwide patient census from 2019). We describe how P. falciparum forms large, interrelated subpopulations that sporadically expand but generally exhibit restrained dispersal, whereby spatial distance and patient travel statistics predict parasite identity-by-descent (IBD). Case bias towards working-age adults is also strongly pronounced. P. vivax exhibits 46\% higher average nucleotide~diversity (π) and 6.5x lower average IBD. It occupies a wider geographic range, without evidence for outbreak-like expansions, only microgeographic patterns of isolation-by-distance, and weaker case bias towards adults. Possible latency-relapse effects also manifest in various analyses. For example, 11.0\% of patients diagnosed with P. vivax in Greater Georgetown report no recent travel to endemic zones, and P. vivax clones recur in 11~of~46 patients incidentally sampled twice during the study. Polyclonality rate is also 2.1x higher than in P. falciparum, does not trend positively with estimated incidence, and correlates uniquely to selected demographics. We discuss possible underlying mechanisms and implications for malaria control.},

  abstract = {There has been a recent trend in genetic studies of wild populations where researchers have changed their sampling schemes from sampling pre-defined populations to sampling individuals uniformly across landscapes. This reflects the fact that many species under study are continuously distributed rather than clumped into obvious “populations”. Once individual samples are collected, many landscape genetic studies use clustering algorithms and multilocus genetic data to group samples into subpopulations. After clusters are derived, landscape features that may be acting as barriers are examined and described. In theory, if populations were evenly sampled, this course of action should reliably identify population structure. However, genetic gradients and irregularly collected samples may impact the composition and location of clusters. We built genetic models where individual genotypes were either randomly distributed across a landscape or contained gradients created by neighbor mating for multiple generations. We investigated the influence of six different sampling protocols on population clustering using program STRUCTURE, the most commonly used model-based clustering method for multilocus genotype data. For models where individuals (and their alleles) were randomly distributed across a landscape, STRUCTURE correctly predicted that only one population was being sampled. However, when gradients created by neighbor mating existed, STRUCTURE detected multiple, but different numbers of clusters, depending on sampling protocols. We recommend testing for fine scale autocorrelation patterns prior to sample clustering, as the scale of the autocorrelation appears to influence the results. Further, we recommend that researchers pay attention to the impacts that sampling may have on subsequent population and landscape genetic results.},

  abstract = {Neutral landscape models (NLMs) simulate landscape patterns based on theoretical distributions and can be used to systematically study the effect of landscape structure on ecological processes. NLMs are commonly used in landscape ecology to enhance the findings of field studies as well as in simulation studies to provide an underlying landscape. However, their creation so far has been limited to software that is platform dependent, does not allow a reproducible workflow or is not embedded in R, the prevailing programming language used by ecologists. Here, we present two complementary R packages NLMR and landscapetools, that allow users to generate and manipulate NLMs in a single environment. They grant the simulation of the widest collection of NLMs found in any single piece of software thus far while allowing for easy manipulation in a self-contained and reproducible workflow. The combination of both packages should stimulate a wider usage of NLMs in ecology. NLMR is a comprehensive collection of algorithms with which to simulate NLMs. landscapetools provides a utility toolbox which facilitates an easy workflow with simulated neutral landscapes and other raster data. We show two example applications that illustrate potential use cases for NLMR and landscapetools: First, an agent-based simulation study in which the effect of spatial structure on disease persistence was studied. The second example shows how increases in spatial scaling can introduce biases in calculated landscape metrics. Simplifying the workflow around generating and handling NLMs should encourage an uptake in the usage of NLMs. NLMR and landscapetools are both generic frameworks that can be used in a variety of applications and are a further step to having a unified simulation environment in R for answering spatial research questions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Substantial reductions in the burden of malaria have been documented in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, with elimination strategies and goals being formulated in some regions. Within this context, understanding the epidemiology of low-level malaria transmission is crucial to achieving and sustaining elimination. A 24 single-nucleotide-polymorphism Plasmodium falciparum molecular barcode was used to characterize parasite populations from infected individuals identified through passive and active case detection in an area approaching malaria elimination in southern Zambia. METHODS: The study was conducted in the catchment area of Macha Hospital in Choma District, Southern Province, Zambia, where the parasite prevalence declined over the past decade, from 9.2\% in 2008 to less than 1\% in 2013. Parasite haplotypes from actively detected, P. falciparum-infected participants enrolled in a serial cross-sectional, community-based cohort study from 2008 to 2013 and from passively detected, P. falciparum-infected individuals enrolled at five rural health centres from 2012 to 2015 were compared. Changes in P. falciparum genetic relatedness, diversity and complexity were analysed as malaria transmission declined. RESULTS: Actively detected cases identified in the community were most commonly rapid diagnostic test negative, asymptomatic and had submicroscopic parasitaemia. Phylogenetic reconstruction using concatenated 24 SNP barcode revealed a separation of parasite haplotypes from passively and actively detected infections, consistent with two genetically distinct parasite populations. For passively detected infections identified at health centres, the proportion of detectable polyclonal infections was consistently low in all seasons, in contrast with actively detected infections in which the proportion of polyclonal infections was high. The mean genetic divergence for passively detected infections was 34.5\% for the 2012-2013 transmission season, 37.8\% for the 2013-2014 season, and 30.8\% for the 2014-2015 season. The mean genetic divergence for actively detected infections was 22.3\% in the 2008 season and 29.0\% in the 2008-2009 season and 9.9\% across the 2012-2014 seasons. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct parasite populations were identified among infected individuals identified through active and passive surveillance, suggesting that infected individuals detected through active surveillance may not have contributed substantially to ongoing transmission. As parasite prevalence and diversity within these individuals declined, resource-intensive efforts to identify the chronically infected reservoir may not be necessary to eliminate malaria in this setting.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The exponential scale and pace of real-time data generated from mobile phones present opportunities for new insights and challenges across multiple sectors, including health care delivery and public health research. However, little attention has been given to the new ethical, social, and legal concerns related to using these mobile technologies and the data they generate in Africa. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to explore the ethical and related concerns that arise from the use of data from call detail records and mobile technology interventions for public health in the context of East Africa. METHODS: We searched the PubMed database for published studies describing ethical challenges while using mobile technologies and related data in public health research between 2000 and 2020. A predefined search strategy was used as inclusion criteria with search terms such as "East Africa," "mHealth," "mobile phone data," "public health," "ethics," or "privacy." We screened studies using prespecified eligibility criteria through a two-stage process by two independent reviewers. Studies were included if they were (1) related to mobile technology use and health, (2) published in English from 2000 to 2020, (3) available in full text, and (4) conducted in the East African region. We excluded articles that (1) were conference proceedings, (2) studies presenting an abstract only, (3) systematic and literature reviews, (4) research protocols, and (5) reports of mobile technology in animal subjects. We followed the five stages of a published framework for scoping reviews recommended by Arksey and O'Malley. Data extracted included title, publication year, target population, geographic region, setting, and relevance to mobile health (mHealth) and ethics. Additionally, we used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist to guide the presentation of this scoping review. The rationale for focusing on the five countries in East Africa was their geographic proximity, which lends itself to similarities in technology infrastructure development. RESULTS: Of the 94 studies identified from PubMed, 33 met the review inclusion criteria for the final scoping review. The 33 articles retained in the final scoping review represent studies conducted in three out of five East African countries: 14 (42\%) from Uganda, 13 (39\%) from Kenya, and 5 (16\%) from Tanzania. Three main categories of concerns related to the use of mHealth technologies and mobile phone data can be conceptualized as (1) ethical issues (adequate informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, data security and protection), (2) sociocultural issues, and (3) regulatory/legal issues. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review identified major cross-cutting ethical, regulatory, and sociocultural concerns related to using data from mobile technologies in the East African region. A comprehensive framework that accounts for the critical concerns raised would be valuable for guiding the safe use of mobile technology data for public health research purposes.},

  abstract = {We hypothesised that digital mapping of various forms of salt-affected soils using high resolution satellite imagery, supported by field studies, would be an efficient method to classify and map salinity, sodicity or both at paddock level, particularly in areas where salt-affected patches are small and the effort to map these by field-based soil survey methods alone would be inordinately time consuming. To test this hypothesis, QuickBird satellite data (pan-sharpened four band multispectral imagery) was used to map various forms of surface-expressed salinity in an agricultural area of South Australia. Ground-truthing was performed by collecting 160 soil samples over the study area of 159km2. Unsupervised classification of the imagery covering the study area allowed differentiation of severity levels of salt-affected soils, but these levels did not match those based on measured electrical conductivity (EC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of the soil samples, primarily because the expression of salinity was strongly influenced by paddock-level variations in crop type, growth and prior land management. Segmentation of the whole image into 450 paddocks and unsupervised classification using a paddock-by-paddock approach resulted in a more accurate discrimination of salinity and sodicity levels that was correlated with EC and SAR. Image-based classes discriminating severity levels of salt-affected soils were significantly related with EC but not with SAR. Of the spectral bands, bands 2 (green, 520-600nm) and 4 (near-infrared, 760-900nm) explained the majority of the variation (99 per cent) in the spectral values. Thus, paddock-by-paddock classification of QuickBird imagery has the potential to accurately delineate salinity at farm level, which will allow more informed decisions about sustainable agricultural management of soils. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because clustering of Plasmodium falciparum infection had been noted previously, the clustering of infection was examined at four field sites in West Africa: Dangassa and Dioro in Mali, Gambissara in The Gambia and Madina Fall in Senegal. METHODS: Clustering of infection was defined by the percent of persons with positive slides for asexual P. falciparum sleeping in a house which had been geopositioned. Data from each site were then tested for spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal clustering in relation to the prevalence of infection from smear surveys. RESULTS: These studies suggest that clustering of P. falciparum infection also affects the effectiveness of control interventions. For example, the clustering of infection in Madina Fall disappeared in 2014-2016 after vector control eliminated the only breeding site in 2013. In contrast, the temporal clustering of infection in Dioro (rainy season of 2014, dry season of 2015) was consistent with the loss of funding for Dioro in the second quarter of 2014 and disappeared when funds again became available in late 2015. The clustering of infection in rural (western) areas of Gambissara was consistent with known rural-urban differences in the prevalence of infection and with the thatched roofs, open eaves and mud walls of houses in rural Gambissara. In contrast, the most intense transmission was in Dangassa, where the only encouraging observation was a lower prevalence of infection in the dry season. Taken together, these results suggest: (a) the transmission of infection was stopped in Madina Fall by eliminating the only known breeding site, (b) the prevalence of infection was reduced in Dioro after financial support became available again for malaria control in the second half of 2015, (c) improvements in housing should improve malaria control by reducing the number of vectors in rural communities such as western Gambissara, and (d) beginning malaria control during the dry season may reduce transmission in hyperendemic areas such as Dangassa. CONCLUSIONS: From a conceptual perspective, testing for spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal clustering based on epidemiologic data permits the generation of hypotheses for the clustering observed and the testing of candidate interventions to confirm or refute those hypotheses.},

Crystallographic studies predict that most imatinib-resistant mutants should remain sensitive to inhibitors that bind ABL with less stringent conformational requirements. BMS-354825 is an orally bioavailable ABL kinase inhibitor with two-log increased potency relative to imatinib that retains activity against 14 of 15 imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. BMS-354825 prolongs survival of mice with BCR-ABL–driven disease and inhibits proliferation of BCR-ABL–positive bone marrow progenitor cells from patients with imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML. These data illustrate how molecular insight into kinase inhibitor resistance can guide the design of second-generation targeted therapies.

  abstract = {The antimalarial efficacy of the most important vector control interventions-long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS)-primarily protect against mosquitoes' biting people when they are in bed and indoors. Mosquito bites taken outside of these times contribute to residual transmission which determines the maximum effectiveness of current malaria prevention. The likelihood mosquitoes feed outside the time of day when LLINs and IRS can protect people is poorly understood, and the proportion of bites received outdoors may be higher after prolonged vector control. A systematic review of mosquito and human behavior is used to quantify and estimate the public health impact of outdoor biting across Africa. On average 79\% of bites by the major malaria vectors occur during the time when people are in bed. This estimate is substantially lower than previous predictions, with results suggesting a nearly 10\% lower proportion of bites taken at the time when people are beneath LLINs since the year 2000. Across Africa, this higher outdoor transmission is predicted to result in an estimated 10.6 million additional malaria cases annually if universal LLIN and IRS coverage was achieved. Higher outdoor biting diminishes the cases of malaria averted by vector control. This reduction in LLIN effectiveness appears to be exacerbated in areas where mosquito populations are resistant to insecticides used in bed nets, but no association was found between physiological resistance and outdoor biting. Substantial spatial heterogeneity in mosquito biting behavior between communities could contribute to differences in effectiveness of malaria control across Africa.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transmission networks of Plasmodium vivax characterize how the parasite transmits from one location to another, which are informative and insightful for public health policy makers to accurately predict the patterns of its geographical spread. However, such networks are not apparent from surveillance data because P. vivax transmission can be affected by many factors, such as the biological characteristics of mosquitoes and the mobility of human beings. Here, we pay special attention to the problem of how to infer the underlying transmission networks of P. vivax based on available tempo-spatial patterns of reported cases. METHODOLOGY: We first define a spatial transmission model, which involves representing both the heterogeneous transmission potential of P. vivax at individual locations and the mobility of infected populations among different locations. Based on the proposed transmission model, we further introduce a recurrent neural network model to infer the transmission networks from surveillance data. Specifically, in this model, we take into account multiple real-world factors, including the length of P. vivax incubation period, the impact of malaria control at different locations, and the total number of imported cases. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We implement our proposed models by focusing on the P. vivax transmission among 62 towns in Yunnan province, People's Republic China, which have been experiencing high malaria transmission in the past years. By conducting scenario analysis with respect to different numbers of imported cases, we can (i) infer the underlying P. vivax transmission networks, (ii) estimate the number of imported cases for each individual town, and (iii) quantify the roles of individual towns in the geographical spread of P. vivax. CONCLUSION: The demonstrated models have presented a general means for inferring the underlying transmission networks from surveillance data. The inferred networks will offer new insights into how to improve the predictability of P. vivax transmission.},

  abstract = {Background Geographic variations of an infectious disease characterize the spatial differentiation of disease incidences caused by various impact factors, such as environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic factors. Some factors may directly determine the force of infection of the disease (namely, explicit factors), while many other factors may indirectly affect the number of disease incidences via certain unmeasurable processes (namely, implicit factors). In this study, the impact of heterogeneous factors on geographic variations of Plasmodium vivax incidences is systematically investigate in Tengchong, Yunnan province, China. Methods A space-time model that resembles a P. vivax transmission model and a hidden time-dependent process, is presented by taking into consideration both explicit and implicit factors. Specifically, the transmission model is built upon relevant demographic, environmental, and biophysical factors to describe the local infections of P. vivax. While the hidden time-dependent process is assessed by several socioeconomic factors to account for the imported cases of P. vivax. To quantitatively assess the impact of heterogeneous factors on geographic variations of P. vivax infections, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation method is developed to estimate the model parameters by fitting the space-time model to the reported spatial-temporal disease incidences. Results Since there is no ground-truth information available, the performance of the MCMC method is first evaluated against a synthetic dataset. The results show that the model parameters can be well estimated using the proposed MCMC method. Then, the proposed model is applied to investigate the geographic variations of P. vivax incidences among all 18 towns in Tengchong, Yunnan province, China. Based on the geographic variations, the 18 towns can be further classify into five groups with similar socioeconomic causality for P. vivax incidences. Conclusions Although this study focuses mainly on the transmission of P. vivax, the proposed space-time model is general and can readily be extended to investigate geographic variations of other diseases. Practically, such a computational model will offer new insights into active surveillance and strategic planning for disease surveillance and control.},

The aims of this study were (1) to develop a set of normalized two-stage vegetation indices (VIs) for characterizing the progressive development of different diseases with rice; (2) to explore the performance of combined normalized two-stage VIs in partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA); and (3) to map and evaluate the damage caused by rice diseases at fine spatial scales, for the first time using bi-temporal, high spatial resolution imagery from PlanetScope datasets at a 3 m spatial resolution. Our findings suggest that the primary biophysical parameters caused by different disease (e.g., changes in leaf area, pigment contents, or canopy morphology) can be captured using combined normalized two-stage VIs. PLS-DA was able to classify rice diseases at a sub-field scale, with an overall accuracy of 75.62\% and a Kappa value of 0.47. The approach was successfully applied during a typical co-epidemic outbreak of rice dwarf (Rice dwarf virus, RDV), rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae), and glume blight (Phyllosticta glumarum) in Guangxi Province, China. Furthermore, our approach highlighted the feasibility of the method in capturing heterogeneous disease patterns at fine spatial scales over the large spatial extents.},

  abstract = {An assumption of correlative landscape genetic methods is that genetic differentiation at neutral markers arises solely from the degree to which the intervening landscape between individuals or populations resists gene flow. However, this assumption is violated when gene flow occurs into the sampled population from an unsampled, differentiated deme. This may happen when sampling within only a portion of a population's extent or when closely related species hybridize with the sampled population. In both cases, violation of the modelling assumptions has the potential to reduce landscape genetic model selection accuracy and result in poor inferences. We used individual-based population genetic simulations in complex landscapes within a model selection framework to explore the potential confounding effect of gene flow from unsampled demes. We hypothesized that as gene flow from outside the sampling extent increased, model selection accuracy would decrease due to the formation of a hybrid zone where allele frequencies were perturbed in a way that was not correlated with effective distances between sampled individuals. Surprisingly, we found this expectation was unfounded, because the reduced accuracy due to admixture was counteracted by an increase in allelic diversity as alleles spread from the unsampled deme into the sampled population. These new alleles increased the power to detect landscape genetic relationships and even slightly improving model selection accuracy overall. This is a reassuring result, suggesting that sampling the full extent of a population or related species that may hybridize may be unnecessary, as long as other well-established sampling requirements are met.},

Hence, mapping these gully features provides essential information needed on sediment production, identification of vulnerable areas for gully formation, land degradation, and environmental and socio-economical effects. This paper investigates the use of object-oriented image analysis (OOA) to extract gully erosion features from satellite imagery, using a combination of topographic, spectral, shape (geometric) and contextual information obtained from IKONOS and GEOEYE-1 data. A rule-set was developed and tested for a semi-arid to sub-humid region in Morocco. The percentage of gully system area indicated negligible overestimations between the reference area and the OOA area in two sub-watersheds (0.03\% and 1.77\%). We also observed that finer gully-related edges within the complex gully systems were better identified semi-automatically than was possible by manual digitization, suggesting higher detection accuracy. OOA-based gully mapping is quicker and more objective than traditional methods, and is thus better suited to provide essential information for land managers to support their decision making processes, and for the erosion research community. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Recurrent infections may arise from activation of dormant liver stages (relapse), blood-stage treatment failure (recrudescence) or reinfection. Molecular inference of familial relatedness (identity-by-descent or IBD) can help resolve the probable origin of recurrences. As whole genome sequencing of P. vivax remains challenging, targeted genotyping methods are needed for scalability. We describe a P. vivax marker discovery framework to identify and select panels of microhaplotypes (multi-allelic markers within small, amplifiable segments of the genome) that can accurately capture IBD. We evaluate panels of 50-250 microhaplotypes discovered in a global set of 615~P. vivax genomes. A candidate global 100-microhaplotype panel exhibits high marker diversity in the Asia-Pacific, Latin America and horn of Africa (median HE\,=\,0.70-0.81) and identifies 89\% of the polyclonal infections detected with genome-wide datasets. Data simulations reveal lower error in estimating pairwise IBD using microhaplotypes relative to traditional biallelic SNP barcodes. The candidate global panel also exhibits high accuracy in predicting geographic origin and captures local infection outbreak and bottlenecking events. Our framework is open-source enabling customised microhaplotype discovery and selection, with potential for porting to other species or data resources.},

  abstract = {A better understanding of malaria persistence in highly seasonal environments such as highlands and desert fringes requires identifying the factors behind the spatial reservoir of the pathogen in the low season. In these 'unstable' malaria regions, such reservoirs play a critical role by allowing persistence during the low transmission season and therefore, between seasonal outbreaks. In the highlands of East Africa, the most populated epidemic regions in Africa, temperature is expected to be intimately connected to where in space the disease is able to persist because of pronounced altitudinal gradients. Here, we explore other environmental and demographic factors that may contribute to malaria's highland reservoir. We use an extensive spatio-temporal dataset of confirmed monthly Plasmodium falciparum cases from 1995 to 2005 that finely resolves space in an Ethiopian highland. With a Bayesian approach for parameter estimation and a generalized linear mixed model that includes a spatially structured random effect, we demonstrate that population density is important to disease persistence during the low transmission season. This population effect is not accounted for in typical models for the transmission dynamics of the disease, but is consistent in part with a more complex functional form of the force of infection proposed by theory for vector-borne infections, only during the low season as we discuss. As malaria risk usually decreases in more urban environments with increased human densities, the opposite counterintuitive finding identifies novel control targets during the low transmission season in African highlands.},

  abstract = {Riverbank retreat along a bend of the Cecina River, Tuscany (central Italy) was monitored across a near annual cycle (autumn 2003 to summer 2004) with the aim of better understanding the factors influencing bank changes and processes at a seasonal scale. Seven flow events occurred during the period of investigation, with the largest having an estimated return period of about 1·5 years. Bank simulations were performed by linking hydrodynamic, fluvial erosion, groundwater flow and bank stability models, for the seven flow events, which are representative of the typical range of hydrographs that normally occur during an annual cycle. The simulations allowed identification of (i) the time of onset and cessation of mass failure and fluvial erosion episodes, (ii) the contributions to total bank retreat made by specific fluvial erosion and mass-wasting processes, and (iii) the causes of retreat. The results show that the occurrence of bank erosion processes (fluvial erosion, slide failure, cantilever failure) and their relative dominance differ significantly for each event, depending on seasonal hydrological conditions and initial bank geometry. Due to the specific planimetric configuration of the study bend, which steers the core of high velocity fluid away from the bank at higher flow discharges, fluvial erosion tends to occur during particular phases of the hydrograph. As a result fluvial erosion is ineffective at higher peak discharges, and depends more on the duration of more moderate discharges. Slide failures appear to be closely related to the magnitude of peak river stages, typically occurring in close proximity to the peak phase (preferentially during the falling limb, but in some cases even before the peak), while cantilever failures more typically occur in the late phase of the flow hydrograph, when they may be induced by the cumulative effects of any fluvial erosion.},

  abstract = {Malaria risk is linked inextricably to the hydrological and geomorphological processes that form vector breeding sites. Yet environmental controls of malaria transmission are often represented by temperature and rainfall amounts, ignoring hydrological and geomorphological influences altogether. Continental-scale studies incorporate hydrology implicitly through simple minimum rainfall thresholds, while community-scale coupled hydrological and entomological models do not represent the actual diversity of the mosquito vector breeding sites. The greatest range of malaria transmission responses to environmental factors is observed at the catchment scale where seemingly contradictory associations between rainfall and malaria risk can be explained by hydrological and geomorphological processes that govern surface water body formation and persistence. This paper extends recent efforts to incorporate ecological factors into malaria-risk models, proposing that the same detailed representation be afforded to hydrological and, at longer timescales relevant for predictions of climate change impacts, geomorphological processes. We review existing representations of environmental controls of malaria and identify a range of hydrologically distinct vector breeding sites from existing literature. We illustrate the potential complexity of interactions among hydrology, geomorphology and vector breeding sites by classifying a range of water bodies observed in a catchment in East Africa. Crucially, the mechanisms driving surface water body formation and destruction must be considered explicitly if we are to produce dynamic spatial models of malaria risk at catchment scales.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although population mobility is frequently cited as a barrier to malaria elimination, a comparatively small body of literature has attempted to systematically examine this issue. This article reviews the literature on malaria and mobile populations in order to critically examine the ways that malaria elimination experts perceive the risks surrounding population mobility. The article brings in perspectives from HIV/AIDS and other infectious disease control programmes working in areas of high population mobility. The article aims to move beyond the current tendency to identify mobile populations as a risk group and suggests ways to reconceptualize and respond to population mobility within malaria elimination. METHODS: The review was commissioned by the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network (APMEN). Searches were made using PubMed, ProQuest, Google and Google Scholar. The review includes English language published peer-reviewed literature and grey literature published up to November 2013. RESULTS: The review identified three key themes in the literature: mobility, economic development and shifting land use; concerns about accessing mobile populations; and imported and border malaria. The review found that the literature treats mobile populations as a homogenous entity and is yet to develop a more accurate understanding of the true risks surrounding population mobility. Concerns about accessing mobile populations are overstated, and methods are suggested for working collaboratively with mobile populations. Finally, the review found that many concerns about mobile populations and imported malaria would be more productively framed as border health issues. CONCLUSION: The focus on mobile populations is both excessive and insufficiently examined within the current literature. By its very nature, population mobility requires malaria elimination programmes to look beyond isolated localities and demographic groups to respond to the interconnections that mobility creates between localities and population groups. Malaria programmes will gain greater clarity by refocusing the discussion away from mobile populations as a risk group and toward mobility as a system involving interconnected localities and multiple demographic groups. Rather than focusing on mobile populations as a risk group and a barrier to elimination, malaria elimination programmes ought to develop collaborative community engagement efforts in border areas and regions of high population mobility and where imported malaria is of concern.},

A variety of passive and active sensors operating in the visible and microwave range are currently operating, or planned, which can estimate inundation area and delineate flood boundaries. Radar altimeters show great promise for directly measuring stage variation in large rivers. It also appears to be possible to obtain estimates of river discharge from space, using ground measurements and satellite data to construct empirical curves that relate water surface area to discharge. Extrapolation of these curves to ungauged sites may be possible for the special case of braided rivers. Where clouds, trees and floating vegetation do not obscure the water surface, high-resolution visible/infrared sensors provide good delineation of inundated areas. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors can penetrate clouds and can also detect standing water through emergent aquatic plants and forest canopies. However, multiple frequencies and polarizations are required for optimal discrimination of various inundated vegetation cover types. Existing single- polarization, fixed-frequency SARs are not sufficient for mapping inundation area in all riverine environments. In the absence of a space-borne multi-parameter SAR, a synergistic approach using single-frequency, fixed-polarization SAR and visible/infrared data will provide the best results over densely vegetated river floodplains.},

  abstract = {The comparative analysis of the population variation patterns exhibited by different types of information has long been a genuine anthropological/genetic preoccupation. One of the generic problems attracting repeated attention is the connection between genetic and cultural consequences of population isolation; we expect both patterns and amounts of variation to reflect the same history of group fission and fusion, but what do we see in practice? Numerous techniques have been employed in such work, all based on comparison of different matrices of pairwise distanceslaffinities. A basic difficulty with all of these methods is that the N(N – 1) pairwise elements of an (N × N) matrix cannot be mutually independent. Recently, a versatile test of matrix correlation that allows for this fact, originally developed by Mantel but since extensively modified and extended, has gained popularity in anthropology, as well as geography, ecology, sociology, psychometrics, population biology, and systematics. We present here a general framework for many of these efforts, based on the Mantel test, and then illustrate its use with four examples from our own work and that of our colleagues: (a) genetic affinity and migrational separation in the Bainwa, (b) clinal versus cluster variation in the Yanomama, (c) genetic, linguistic, and geographic affinities among the Chibcha-speaking tribes, and (d) migration and genetic affinity in the Gainj and Kalam. The technique is nonparametric and so general that it is useful for many different types of pattern comparison, even when the connections between different types of information are poorly understood. Greater analytic potential is generally realized when there are definite theoretical connections between the patterns being compared. With theoretical care and a bit of imagination, one can combine the advantages of parametric assumptions with the robustness of nonparametric analysis. Novel analyses and anthropological opportunities are emerging continuously. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Introduction Understanding the spatiotemporal clustering of malaria transmission would help target interventions in settings of low malaria transmission. The aim of this study was to assess whether malaria infections were clustered in areas with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) alone, indoor residual spraying (IRS) alone, or a combination of LLINs and IRS interventions, and to determine the risk factors for the observed malaria clustering in southern-central Ethiopia. Methods A cohort of 34,548 individuals residing in 6,071 households was followed for 121 weeks, from October 2014 to January 2017. Both active and passive case detection mechanisms were used to identify clinical malaria episodes, and there were no geographic heterogeneity in data collection methods. Using SaTScan software v 9.4.4, a discrete Poisson model was used to identify high rates of spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal malaria clustering. A multilevel logistic regression model was fitted to identify predictors of spatial malaria clustering. Results The overall incidence of malaria was 16.5 per 1,000 person-year observations. Spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal clustering of malaria was detected in all types of malaria infection (P. falciparum, P. vivax, or mixed). Spatial clustering was identified in all study arms: for LLIN + IRS arm, a most likely cluster size of 169 cases in 305 households [relative risk (RR) = 4.54, P{$<$}0.001]; for LLIN alone arm a cluster size of 88 cases in 103 households (RR = 5.58, P{$<$}0.001); for IRS alone arm a cluster size of 58 cases in 50 households (RR = 7.15, P{$<$}0.001), and for control arm a cluster size of 147 cases in 377 households (RR = 2.78, P{$<$}0.001). Living 1 km closer to potential vector breeding sites increased the odds of being in spatial clusters by 41.32 fold (adjusted OR = 41.32, 95\% CI = 3.79–138.89). Conclusions The risk of malaria infection varied significantly between kebeles, within kebeles, and even among households in areas targeted for different types of malaria control interventions in low malaria transmission setting. The results of this study can be used in planning and implementation of malaria control strategies at micro-geographic scale.},

  abstract = {Drought is a complex natural phenomenon, and its impacts on agriculture are enormous. Drought has been a prevalent concern for farmers in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) over the last decades; thus, monitoring drought is important for water planning and management to mitigate impacts on agriculture in the region. This study explored the applicability of monthly MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) data for agricultural drought monitoring in LMB in the dry season from November 2001 to April 2010. The data were processed using the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), calculated by parameterizing the relationship between the MODIS NDVI and LST data. The daily volumetric surface soil moisture from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and monthly precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) were collected and used for verification of the results. In addition, we compared the efficiency of TVDI with a commonly used drought index, the crop water stress index (CWSI), derived from the MODIS LST alone. The results achieved from comparisons between TVDI and AMSR-E soil moisture data indicated acceptable correlations between the two datasets in most cases. There was close agreement between TVDI and TRMM precipitation data through the season, indicating that TVDI was sensitive to precipitation. The TVDI compared to CWSI also yielded close correlations between both datasets. The TVDI was, however, more sensitive to soil moisture stress than CWSI. The results archived by analysis of TVDI indicated that the moderate and severe droughts were spatially scattered over the region from November to March, but more extensive in northeast Thailand and Cambodia. The larger area of severe drought was especially observed for the 2003-2006 dry seasons compared to other years. The results achieved from this study could be important for drought warnings and irrigation scheduling. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Methods of computing this index differ primarily in the way the upslope contributing area is calculated. In this study we compared a number of calculation methods for TWI and evaluated them in terms of their correlation with the following measured variables: vascular plant species richness, soil pH, groundwater level, soil moisture, and a constructed wetness degree. The TWI was calculated by varying six parameters affecting the distribution of accumulated area among downslope cells and by varying the way the slope was calculated. All possible combinations of these parameters were calculated for two separate boreal forest sites in northern Sweden. We did not find a calculation method that performed best for all measured variables; rather the best methods seemed to be variable and site specific. However, we were able to identify some general characteristics of the best methods for different groups of measured variables. The results provide guiding principles for choosing the best method for estimating species richness, soil pH, groundwater level, and soil moisture by the TWI derived from digital elevation models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In malaria pathosystems, Plasmodium parasites have been reported to alter mosquito physiology, fitness and host-seeking behavior. Such effects on vector behavior have obvious medical relevance given their potential to influence disease transmission. However, most studies detailing these effects have faced methodological limitations, including experiments limited to laboratory settings with model vector/pathogen systems. Some recent studies indicate that similar effects may not be observed with natural field populations; furthermore, it has been suggested that previously reported effects on vectors might be explained by immune responses elicited due to the use of pathogen–vector systems that are not co-evolved. In light of these developments, further work is needed to determine the validity of extrapolation from laboratory studies to field conditions and to understand how parasite effects on vectors affect transmission dynamics in real-world settings.},

  abstract = {Background: Spatio-temporal trends in mosquito-borne diseases are driven by the locations and seasonality of larval habitat. One method of disease control is to decrease the mosquito population by modifying larval habitat, known as larval source management (LSM). In malaria control, LSM is currently considered impractical in rural areas due to perceived difficulties in identifying target areas. High resolution drone mapping is being considered as a practical solution to address this barrier. In this paper, the authors' experiences of drone-led larval habitat identification in Malawi were used to assess the feasibility of this approach. Methods: Drone mapping and larval surveys were conducted in Kasungu district, Malawi between 2018 and 2020. Water bodies and aquatic vegetation were identified in the imagery using manual methods and geographical object-based image analysis (GeoOBIA) and the performances of the classifications were compared. Further, observations were documented on the practical aspects of capturing drone imagery for informing malaria control including cost, time, computing, and skills requirements. Larval sampling sites were characterized by biotic factors visible in drone imagery and generalized linear mixed models were used to determine their association with larval presence. Results: Imagery covering an area of 8.9 km2 across eight sites was captured. Larval habitat characteristics were successfully identified using GeoOBIA on images captured by a standard camera (median accuracy = 98\%) with no notable improvement observed after incorporating data from a near-infrared sensor. This approach however required greater processing time and technical skills compared to manual identification. Larval samples captured from 326 sites confirmed that drone-captured characteristics, including aquatic vegetation presence and type, were significantly associated with larval presence. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential for drone-acquired imagery to support mosquito larval habitat identification in rural, malaria-endemic areas, although technical challenges were identified which may hinder the scale up of this approach. Potential solutions have however been identified, including strengthening linkages with the flourishing drone industry in countries such as Malawi. Further consultations are therefore needed between experts in the fields of drones, image analysis and vector control are needed to develop more detailed guidance on how this technology can be most effectively exploited in malaria control.},

  abstract = {Background Human movement is a key behavioral factor in many vector-borne disease systems because it influences exposure to vectors and thus the transmission of pathogens. Human movement transcends spatial and temporal scales with different influences on disease dynamics. Here we develop a conceptual model to evaluate the importance of variation in exposure due to individual human movements for pathogen transmission, focusing on mosquito-borne dengue virus. Methodology and Principal Findings We develop a model showing that the relevance of human movement at a particular scale depends on vector behavior. Focusing on the day-biting Aedes aegypti, we illustrate how vector biting behavior combined with fine-scale movements of individual humans engaged in their regular daily routine can influence transmission. Using a simple example, we estimate a transmission rate (R0) of 1.3 when exposure is assumed to occur only in the home versus 3.75 when exposure at multiple locations—e.g., market, friend's—due to movement is considered. Movement also influences for which sites and individuals risk is greatest. For the example considered, intriguingly, our model predicts little correspondence between vector abundance in a site and estimated R0 for that site when movement is considered. This illustrates the importance of human movement for understanding and predicting the dynamics of a disease like dengue. To encourage investigation of human movement and disease, we review methods currently available to study human movement and, based on our experience studying dengue in Peru, discuss several important questions to address when designing a study. Conclusions/Significance Human movement is a critical, understudied behavioral component underlying the transmission dynamics of many vector-borne pathogens. Understanding movement will facilitate identification of key individuals and sites in the transmission of pathogens such as dengue, which then may provide targets for surveillance, intervention, and improved disease prevention.},

The scene model generalizes and parameterizes the essential qualities of the scene. Scene models may be discrete, in which the scene model consists of discrete elements with boundaries, or continuous, in which matter and energy flows are taken to be continuous and there are no clear or sharp boundaries in the scene. In the discrete case, there are two possibilities for models: H- and L-resolution. In the H-resolution case, the resolution cells of the image are smaller than the elements, and thus the elements may be individually resolved. In the L-resolution case, the resolution cells are larger than the elements and cannot be resolved. Most canopy models are L-resolution, deterministic, and noninvertible in nature; image processing models, however, tend to be H-resolution, empirical, and invertible. This taxonomy helps add insight to the development of remote sensing theory and point the way to new, productive areas of research.}

  abstract = {Anticipating how epidemics will spread across landscapes requires understanding host dispersal events that are notoriously difficult to measure. Here, we contrast host and virus genetic signatures to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying geographic expansions of vampire bat rabies virus (VBRV) in Peru. Phylogenetic analysis revealed recent viral spread between populations that, according to extreme geographic structure in maternally inherited host mitochondrial DNA, appeared completely isolated. In contrast, greater population connectivity in biparentally inherited nuclear microsatellites explained the historical limits of invasions, suggesting that dispersing male bats spread VBRV between genetically isolated female populations. Host nuclear DNA further indicated unanticipated gene flow through the Andes mountains connecting the VBRV-free Pacific coast to the VBRV-endemic Amazon rainforest. By combining Bayesian phylogeography with landscape resistance models, we projected invasion routes through northern Peru that were validated by real-time livestock rabies mortality data. The first outbreaks of VBRV on the Pacific coast of South America could occur by June 2020, which would have serious implications for agriculture, wildlife conservation, and human health. Our results show that combining host and pathogen genetic data can identify sex biases in pathogen spatial spread, which may be a widespread but underappreciated phenomenon, and demonstrate that genetic forecasting can aid preparedness for impending viral invasions.},

It is unclear to what extent different metrics lead to consistent delineation of hotspot boundaries. Using data from a large community-based malaria survey in the western Kenyan highlands, we assessed the agreement between a model-based geostatistical (MBG) approach to detect hotspots using Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence and serological evidence for exposure. Malaria transmission was widespread and highly heterogeneous with one third of the total population living in hotspots regardless of metric tested. Moderate agreement (Kappa\,=\,0.424) was observed between hotspots defined based on parasite prevalence by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- and the prevalence of antibodies to two P. falciparum antigens (MSP-1, AMA-1). While numerous biologically plausible hotspots were identified, their detection strongly relied on the proportion of the population sampled. When only 3\% of the population was sampled, no PCR derived hotspots were reliably detected and at least 21\% of the population was needed for reliable results. Similar results were observed for hotspots of seroprevalence. Hotspot boundaries are driven by the malaria diagnostic and sample size used to inform the model. These findings warn against the simplistic use of spatial analysis on available data to target malaria interventions in areas where hotspot boundaries are uncertain.},

Hotspots are a consistent feature of malaria transmission at all endemicities. The smallest spatial unit capable of supporting transmission is the household, where peri-domestic transmission occurs. Whilst the value of focusing interventions to high-burden areas is evident, there is currently limited evidence that local-scale hotspots fuel transmission. As boundaries are often uncertain, there is no conclusive evidence that hotspot-targeted interventions accelerate malaria elimination.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reactive malaria strategies are predicated on the assumption that individuals infected with malaria are clustered within households or neighbourhoods. Despite the widespread programmatic implementation of reactive strategies, little empirical evidence exists as to whether such strategies are appropriate and, if so, how they should be most effectively implemented. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collated 2 different datasets to assess clustering of malaria infections within households: (i) demographic health survey (DHS) data, integrating household information and patent malaria infection, recent fever, and recent treatment status in children; and (ii) data from cross-sectional and reactive detection studies containing information on the household and malaria infection status (patent and subpatent) of all-aged individuals. Both datasets were used to assess the odds of infections clustering within index households, where index households were defined based on whether they contained infections detectable through one of 3 programmatic strategies: (a) Reactive Case Detection (RACD) classifed by confirmed clinical cases, (b) Mass Screen and Treat (MSAT) classifed by febrile, symptomatic infections, and (c) Mass Test and Treat (MTAT) classifed by infections detectable using routine diagnostics. Data included 59,050 infections in 208,140 children under 7 years old (median age = 2 years, minimum = 2, maximum = 7) by microscopy/rapid diagnostic test (RDT) from 57 DHSs conducted between November 2006 and December 2018 from 23 African countries. Data representing 11,349 infections across all ages (median age = 22 years, minimum = 0.5, maximum = 100) detected by molecular tools in 132,590 individuals in 43 studies published between April 2006 and May 2019 in 20 African, American, Asian, and Middle Eastern countries were obtained from the published literature. Extensive clustering was observed-overall, there was a 20.40 greater (95\% credible interval [CrI] 0.35-20.45; P {$<$} 0.001) odds of patent infections (according to the DHS data) and 5.13 greater odds (95\% CI 3.85-6.84; P {$<$} 0.001) of molecularly detected infections (from the published literature) detected within households in which a programmatically detectable infection resides. The strongest degree of clustering identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/ loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was observed using the MTAT strategy (odds ratio [OR] = 6.79, 95\% CI 4.42-10.43) but was not significantly different when compared to MSAT (OR = 5.2, 95\% CI 3.22-8.37; P-difference = 0.883) and RACD (OR = 4.08, 95\% CI 2.55-6.53; P-difference = 0.29). Across both datasets, clustering became more prominent when transmission was low. However, limitations to our analysis include not accounting for any malaria control interventions in place, malaria seasonality, or the likely heterogeneity of transmission within study sites. Clustering may thus have been underestimated. CONCLUSIONS: In areas where malaria transmission is peri-domestic, there are programmatic options for identifying households where residual infections are likely to be found. Combining these detection strategies with presumptively treating residents of index households over a sustained time period could contribute to malaria elimination efforts.},

In~vitro evolution of resistance with two antiplasmodial drug-like compounds (MMV019721 and MMV084978) selects for mutations in PfAcAS. Metabolic profiling of compound-treated parasites reveals changes in acetyl-CoA levels for both compounds. Genome editing confirms that mutations in PfAcAS are sufficient to confer resistance. Knockdown studies demonstrate that PfAcAS is essential for asexual growth, and partial knockdown induces hypersensitivity to both compounds. In~vitro biochemical assays using recombinantly expressed PfAcAS validates that MMV019721 and MMV084978 directly inhibit the enzyme by preventing CoA and acetate binding, respectively. Immunolocalization studies reveal that PfAcAS is primarily localized to the nucleus. Functional studies demonstrate inhibition of histone acetylation in compound-treated wild-type, but not in resistant parasites. Our findings identify and validate PfAcAS as an essential, druggable target involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.},

METHODS: We investigated how new, recurrent, and persistent Plasmodium falciparum infections were associated with the odds of developing symptomatic compared with asymptomatic malaria. Using a 14-month longitudinal cohort in Western Kenya, we used amplicon deep sequencing of 2 polymorphic genes (pfama1 and pfcsp) to assess overlap of parasite genotypes (represented by haplotypes) acquired within an individual's successive infections. We hypothesized infections with novel haplotypes would increase the odds of symptomatic malaria. RESULTS: After excluding initial infections, we observed 534 asymptomatic and 88 symptomatic infections across 186 people. We detected 109 pfcsp haplotypes, and each infection was classified as harboring novel, recurrent, or persistent haplotypes. Incident infections with only new haplotypes had higher odds of symptomatic malaria when compared with infections with only recurrent haplotypes [odds ratio (OR): 3.24; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.20-8.78], but infections with both new and recurrent haplotypes (OR: 0.64; 95\% CI: 0.15-2.65) did not. Assessing persistent infections, those with mixed (persistent with new or recurrent) haplotypes (OR: 0.77; 95\% CI: 0.21-2.75) had no association with symptomatic malaria compared with infections with only persistent haplotypes. Results were similar for pfama1. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that incident infections with only novel haplotypes were associated with increased odds of symptomatic malaria compared with infections with only recurrent haplotypes but this relationship was not seen when haplotypes persisted over time in consecutive infections.},

We assess the contribution of asymptomatic malaria to onward transmission using a 14-month longitudinal cohort of 239 participants in a high transmission site in Western Kenya. We identify P. falciparum in asymptomatically- and symptomatically-infected participants and naturally-fed mosquitoes from their households, genotype all parasites using deep sequencing of the parasite genes pfama1 and pfcsp, and use haplotypes to infer participant-to-mosquito transmission through a probabilistic model. In 1,242 infections (1,039 in people and 203 in mosquitoes), we observe 229 (pfcsp) and 348 (pfama1) unique parasite haplotypes. Using these to link human and mosquito infections, compared with symptomatic infections, asymptomatic infections more than double the odds of transmission to a mosquito among people with both infection types (Odds Ratio: 2.56; 95\% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.36-4.81) and among all participants (OR 2.66; 95\% CI: 2.05-3.47). Overall, 94.6\% (95\% CI: 93.1-95.8\%) of mosquito infections likely resulted from asymptomatic infections.

The recent floods in the Midwestern United States in June 2008 and in the New Orleans area in August 2005 were selected for this study. MODIS surface reflectance with the matched land cover data in the Midwest prior to the flooding events were used for the training dataset, with the split test mode of 50\% for training and the remaining 50\% for testing. The precision, or accuracy rate, of the water classification reaches over 90\% from the test. Our results demonstrate that the reflectance difference (CH2-CH1) between the MODIS channel 2 (CH2) and channel 1 (CH1) is the most useful parameter to derive water fraction from the linear mixture model. Rules and threshold values from the decision tree training were applied to real applications on different dates (June 1, 17, and 19, 2008 for the Midwestern region of the U.S.) and at different locations (New Orleans in 2005) to identify standing water and to calculate water fraction. The derived water fraction maps were evaluated using higher resolution Thematic Mapper (TM) data from Landsat observations. It shows that the correlation between water fractions derived from the MODIS and TM data is 0.97, with difference or “bias” of 4.47\%, standard deviation of 4.40\%, and root mean square error (rmse) of 6.28\%. Flood distributions in both space and time domains were generated using the differences in water fraction values before and after the flooding.},

  abstract = {Molecular epidemiology using genomic data can help identify relationships between malaria parasite population structure, malaria transmission intensity, and ultimately help generate actionable data to assess the effectiveness of malaria control strategies. Genomic data, coupled with geographic information systems data, can further identify clusters or hotspots of malaria transmission, parasite genetic and spatial connectivity, and parasite movement by human or mosquito mobility over time and space. In this study, we performed longitudinal genomic surveillance in a cohort of 70 participants over four years from different neighborhoods and households in Thiès, Senegal-a region of exceptionally low malaria transmission (entomological inoculation rate less than 1). Genetic identity (identity by state, IBS) was established using a 24-single nucleotide polymorphism molecular barcode, identity by descent was calculated from whole genome sequence data, and a hierarchical Bayesian regression model was used to establish genetic and spatial relationships. Our results show clustering of genetically similar parasites within households and a decline in genetic similarity of parasites with increasing distance. One household showed extremely high diversity and warrants further investigation as to the source of these diverse genetic types. This study illustrates the utility of genomic data with traditional epidemiological approaches for surveillance and detection of trends and patterns in malaria transmission not only by neighborhood but also by household. This approach can be implemented regionally and countrywide to strengthen and support malaria control and elimination efforts.},

Ebbs and floods, black and white waters, fishponds, and “repiquete” (Amazonian waters phenomenon) influence the density of Anopheles darlingi Root, 1926. The adaptive processes, genetic background, and resilience of Anopheles vectors change in response to climate and environmental changes. This study covers the diversity of anophelines, which increases due to anthropic activities. Regarding strategies for vector control, the following measures are important: (1) use mechanical barriers inside houses (screens and impregnated mosquito nets), (2) determine the level of anopheline resistance to insecticides, and (3) determine the effect of the physiological state of females on malaria transmission effectiveness. Bioinsecticides were found to be efficient in the control of immatures, and there was no alteration of the associated fauna. Data on genetic variability and vector populations demonstrated greater polymorphism in intradomicile subpopulations. Furthermore, knowledge on the structural genome and transcriptome of A. darlingi, associated with bio-ecology and evolution, may indicate an adaptive strategy of this species to the Amazon biome. There are anthropic activities and environmental and climatic changes that favor increased vector density, requiring specific control strategies to reduce populations of this species.},

It is found that the correlation between these two estimates is large when the sample size is small, and decreases slowly as the sample size increases. Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion (greater than 100 bp) is deleterious. It is suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.},

These studies were categorized according to spatiotemporal scales of human mobility and the main method of analysis. Results Evidence gaps exist for tracking routine cross-border HPM and HPM at a regional scale. Few studies accounted for seasonality. Out of twenty included studies, two studies which tracked daily neighbourhood HPM used descriptive analyses as the main method, while the remaining studies used statistical analyses or mathematical modelling.

Three current issues are: linking spatial patterns and processes, representing hierarchical relations across scales, and considering nonlinearity to address complex non-stationary settlement dynamics. We present a hierarchical simulation model to investigate complex rural settlement dynamics in Nang Rong, Thailand. This simulation uses sub-models to allocate new villages at three spatial scales. Regional and sub-regional models, which involve a nonlinear space–time autoregressive model implemented in a neural network approach, determine the number of new villages to be established. A dynamic village niche model, establishing a pattern–process link, was designed to enable the allocation of villages into specific locations. Spatiotemporal variability in model performance indicates that the pattern of village location changes as a settlement frontier advances from rice-growing lowlands to higher elevations. Simulation experiments demonstrate that this simulation model can enhance our understanding of settlement development in Nang Rong and thus gain insight into complex land use systems in this area.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a problem for many countries classified as malaria free through cases imported from endemic regions. Imported cases to non-endemic countries often result in delays in diagnosis, are expensive to treat, and can sometimes cause secondary local transmission. The movement of malaria in endemic countries has also contributed to the spread of drug resistance and threatens long-term eradication goals. Here we focused on quantifying the international movements of malaria to improve our understanding of these phenomena and facilitate the design of mitigation strategies. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we studied the database of publicly available nationally reported statistics on imported malaria in the past 10 years, covering more than 50\hphantom{,}000 individual cases. We obtained data from 40 non-endemic countries and recorded the geographical variations. FINDINGS: Infection movements were strongly skewed towards a small number of high-traffic routes between 2005 and 2015, with the west Africa region accounting for 56\% (13\hphantom{,}947/24\hphantom{,}941) of all imported cases to non-endemic countries with a reported travel destination, and France and the UK receiving the highest number of cases, with more than 4000 reported cases per year on average. Countries strongly linked by movements of imported cases are grouped by historical, language, and travel ties. There is strong spatial clustering of plasmodium species types. INTERPRETATION: The architecture of the air network, historical ties, demographics of travellers, and malaria endemicity contribute to highly heterogeneous patterns of numbers, routes, and species compositions of parasites transported. With global malaria eradication on the international agenda, malaria control altering local transmission, and the threat of drug resistance, understanding these patterns and their drivers is increasing in importance.

Evidence from the previous global malaria eradication program and more recent transborder control campaigns have shown the importance of accounting for human movement in introducing infections to areas targeted for elimination. Here, census-based migration data were analyzed with network analysis tools, Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission maps, and global population databases to map globally communities of countries linked by relatively high levels of infection movements. The likely principal sources and destinations of imported cases in each region were also mapped. Results indicate that certain groups of countries, such as those in West Africa and central Asia are much more strongly connected by relatively high levels of population and infection movement than others. In contrast, countries such as Ethiopia and Myanmar display significantly greater isolation in terms of likely infection movements in and out. The mapping here of both communities of countries linked by likely higher levels of infection movement, and "natural" migration boundaries that display reduced movement of people and infections between regions has practical utility. These maps can inform the design of malaria elimination strategies by identifying regional communities of countries afforded protection from recolonization by surrounding regions of reduced migration. For more isolated countries, a nationally focused control or elimination program is likely to stand a better chance of success than those receiving high levels of visitors and migrants from high-transmission regions.},

  abstract = {Understanding the relatedness of individuals within or between populations is a common goal in biology. Increasingly, relatedness features in genetic epidemiology studies of pathogens. These studies are relatively new compared to those in humans and other organisms, but are important for designing interventions and understanding pathogen transmission. Only recently have researchers begun to routinely apply relatedness to apicomplexan eukaryotic malaria parasites, and to date have used a range of different approaches on an ad hoc basis. Therefore, it remains unclear how to compare different studies and which measures to use. Here, we systematically compare measures based on identity-by-state (IBS) and identity-by-descent (IBD) using a globally diverse data set of malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, and provide marker requirements for estimates based on IBD. We formally show that the informativeness of polyallelic markers for relatedness inference is maximized when alleles are equifrequent. Estimates based on IBS are sensitive to allele frequencies, which vary across populations and by experimental design. For portability across studies, we thus recommend estimates based on IBD. To generate estimates with errors below an arbitrary threshold of 0.1, we recommend ∼100 polyallelic or 200 biallelic markers. Marker requirements are immediately applicable to haploid malaria parasites and other haploid eukaryotes. C.I.s facilitate comparison when different marker sets are used. This is the first attempt to provide rigorous analysis of the reliability of, and requirements for, relatedness inference in malaria genetic epidemiology. We hope it will provide a basis for statistically informed prospective study design and surveillance strategies.},

The frequency of a genetic motif (proportion of parasite clones in the parasite population that carry a given allele, haplotype or genotype) is a useful measure of resistance. In areas of high endemicity, malaria patients generally harbour multiple parasite clones; they have multiplicities of infection (MOIs) greater than one. However, most standard experimental procedures only allow measurement of marker prevalence (proportion of patient blood samples that test positive for a given mutation or combination of mutations), not frequency. It is misleading to compare marker prevalence between sites that have different mean MOIs; frequencies are required instead.},

  abstract = {Characterising connectivity between geographically separated biological populations is a common goal in many fields. Recent approaches to understanding connectivity between malaria parasite populations, with implications for disease control efforts, have used estimates of relatedness based on identity-by-descent (IBD). However, uncertainty around estimated relatedness has not been accounted for. IBD-based relatedness estimates with uncertainty were computed for pairs of monoclonal Plasmodium falciparum samples collected from five cities on the Colombian-Pacific coast where long-term clonal propagation of P. falciparum is frequent. The cities include two official ports, Buenaventura and Tumaco, that are separated geographically but connected by frequent marine traffic. Fractions of highly-related sample pairs (whose classification using a threshold accounts for uncertainty) were greater within cities versus between. However, based on both highly-related fractions and on a threshold-free approach (Wasserstein distances between parasite populations) connectivity between Buenaventura and Tumaco was disproportionally high. Buenaventura-Tumaco connectivity was consistent with transmission events involving parasites from five clonal components (groups of statistically indistinguishable parasites identified under a graph theoretic framework). To conclude, P. falciparum population connectivity on the Colombian-Pacific coast abides by accessibility not isolation-by-distance, potentially implicating marine traffic in malaria transmission with opportunities for targeted intervention. Further investigations are required to test this hypothesis. For the first time in malaria epidemiology (and to our knowledge in ecological and epidemiological studies more generally), we account for uncertainty around estimated relatedness (an important consideration for studies that plan to use genotype versus whole genome sequence data to estimate IBD-based relatedness); we also use threshold-free methods to compare parasite populations and identify clonal components. Threshold-free methods are especially important in analyses of malaria parasites and other recombining organisms with mixed mating systems where thresholds do not have clear interpretation (e.g. due to clonal propagation) and thus undermine the cross-comparison of studies.},

  abstract = {With the rapidly increasing abundance and accessibility of genomic data, there is a growing interest in using population genetic approaches to characterize fine-scale dispersal of organisms, providing insight into biological processes across a broad range of fields including ecology, evolution and epidemiology. For sexually recombining haploid organisms such as the human malaria parasite P. falciparum, however, there have been no systematic assessments of the type of data and methods required to resolve fine scale connectivity. This analytical gap hinders the use of genomics for understanding local transmission patterns, a crucial goal for policy makers charged with eliminating this important human pathogen. Here we use data collected from four clinics with a catchment area spanning approximately 120 km of the Thai-Myanmar border to compare the ability of divergence (FST) and relatedness based on identity by descent (IBD) to resolve spatial connectivity between malaria parasites collected from proximal clinics. We found no relationship between inter-clinic distance and FST, likely due to sampling of highly related parasites within clinics, but a significant decline in IBD-based relatedness with increasing inter-clinic distance. This association was contingent upon the data set type and size. We estimated that approximately 147 single-infection whole genome sequenced parasite samples or 222 single-infection parasite samples genotyped at 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were sufficient to recover a robust spatial trend estimate at this scale. In summary, surveillance efforts cannot rely on classical measures of genetic divergence to measure P. falciparum transmission on a local scale. Given adequate sampling, IBD-based relatedness provides a useful alternative, and robust trends can be obtained from parasite samples genotyped at approximately 100 SNPs.},

  abstract = {Malaria parasites are haploid within humans, but infections often contain genetically distinct groups of clonal parasites. When the per-infection number of genetically distinct clones (i.e., the multiplicity of infection, MOI) exceeds one, and per-infection genetic data are generated in bulk, important information are obfuscated. For example, the MOI, the phases of the haploid genotypes of genetically distinct clones (i.e., how the alleles concatenate into sequences), and their frequencies. This complicates many downstream analyses, including relatedness estimation. MOIs, parasite sequences, their frequencies, and degrees of relatedness are used ubiquitously in malaria studies: for example, to monitor anti-malarial drug resistance and to track changes in transmission. In this article, MrsFreqPhase methods designed to estimate statistically malaria parasite MOI, relatedness, frequency and phase are reviewed. An overview, a historical account of the literature, and a statistical description of contemporary software is provided for each method class. The article ends with a look towards future method development, needed to make best use of new data types generated by cutting-edge malaria studies reliant on MrsFreqPhase methods.},

In a live phylogeny, both ancestral and living taxa may coexist, leading to a tree where internal nodes may be living taxa.

We have investigated Live Neighbor-Joining on datasets of viral genomes, a plausible scenario for its application, which allowed the construction of alternative hypothesis for the relationships among virus that embrace both ancestral and descending taxa. We also applied Live Neighbor-Joining on a set of bacterial genomes and to sets of images and texts. Non-biological data may be better explored visually when their relationship in terms of content similarity is represented by means of a phylogeny. CONCLUSION: Our experiments have shown interesting alternative phylogenetic hypothesis for RNA virus genomes, bacterial genomes and alternative relationships among images and texts, illustrating a wide range of scenarios where Live Neighbor-Joining may be used.},

The current understanding of malaria transmission dynamics and parasite movement mainly relies on the analyses of epidemiologic data, e.g. case counts and self-reported travel history data. However, travel history data are often not routinely collected or are incomplete, lacking the necessary level of accuracy. Although genetic data from routinely collected field samples provides an unprecedented opportunity to track the spread of malaria parasites, it remains an underutilized resource for surveillance due to lack of local awareness and capacity, limited access to sensitive laboratory methods and associated computational tools and difficulty in interpreting genetic epidemiology data. In this review, the potential roles of NGS in better understanding of transmission patterns, accurately tracking parasite movement and addressing the emerging challenges of imported malaria in low transmission settings of sub-Saharan Africa are discussed. Furthermore, this review highlights the insights gained from malaria genomic research and challenges associated with integrating malaria genomics into existing surveillance tools to inform control and elimination strategies.},

Knowledge of local disease transmission patterns in endemic countries is critical to these elimination efforts. To investigate fine-scale patterns of malaria transmission, we have compared repertoires of rapidly evolving var genes in a highly endemic area. A total of 3680 high-quality DBLα-sequences were obtained from 68 P.~falciparum isolates from ten villages spread over two distinct catchment areas on the north coast of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Modelling of the extent of var gene diversity in the two parasite populations predicts more than twice as many var gene alleles circulating within each catchment (Mugil~=~906; Wosera~=~1094) than previously recognized in PNG (Amele~=~369). In addition, there were limited levels of var gene sharing between populations, consistent with local parasite population structure. Phylogeographic analyses demonstrate that while neutrally evolving microsatellite markers identified population structure only at the catchment level, var gene repertoires reveal further fine-scale geospatial clustering of parasite isolates. The clustering of parasite isolates by village in Mugil, but not in Wosera was consistent with the physical and cultural isolation of the human populations in the two catchments. The study highlights the microheterogeneity of P.~falciparum transmission in highly endemic areas and demonstrates the potential of var genes as markers of local patterns of parasite population structure.},

However, methods to identify and sequence these genomic regions are currently limited. METHODS: A bioinformatic pipeline and multiplex methods were developed to identify and simultaneously sequence 100 targets and applied to dried blood spot (DBS) controls and field isolates from Mozambique. For comparison, whole-genome sequencing data were generated for the same controls. RESULTS: Using publicly available genomes, 4465 high-diversity genomic regions suited for targeted sequencing were identified, representing the P. falciparum heterozygome. For this study, 93 microhaplotypes with high diversity (median expected heterozygosity\>=\>0.7) were selected along with 7 drug resistance loci. The sequencing method achieved very high coverage (median 99\%), specificity (99.8\%), and sensitivity (90\% for haplotypes with 5\% within sample frequency in dried blood spots with 100 parasites/µL). In silico analyses revealed that microhaplotypes provided much higher resolution to discriminate related from unrelated polyclonal infections than biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphism barcodes. CONCLUSIONS: The bioinformatic and laboratory methods outlined here provide a flexible tool for efficient, low-cost, high-throughput interrogation of the P. falciparum genome, and can be tailored to simultaneously address multiple questions of interest in various epidemiological settings.},

Understanding this clustering may allow identification and targeting of pockets of transmission. In Adama district, Ethiopia, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria patients and controls were examined, together with household members and immediate neighbors. Rapid diagnostic test and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were used for the detection of infections that were genetically characterized by a panel of microsatellite loci for P. falciparum (26) and P. vivax (11), respectively. Individuals living in households of clinical P. falciparum patients were more likely to have qPCR detected P. falciparum infections (22.0\%, 9/41) compared to individuals in control households (8.7\%, 37/426; odds ratio, 2.9; 95\% confidence interval, 1.3-6.4; P\,=\,.007). Genetically related P. falciparum, but not P. vivax infections showed strong clustering within households. Genotyping revealed a marked temporal cluster of P. falciparum infections, almost exclusively comprised of clinical cases. These findings uncover previously unappreciated transmission dynamics and support a rational approach to reactive case detection strategies for P. falciparum in Ethiopia.},

To address this challenge, we systematically collected parasite genetic data and travel history from thousands of malaria cases across northeastern Namibia and estimated human mobility from mobile phone data. We observed strong fine-scale spatial structure in local parasite populations, providing positive evidence that the majority of cases were due to local transmission. This result was largely consistent with estimates from mobile phone and travel history data. However, genetic data identified more detailed and extensive evidence of parasite connectivity over hundreds of kilometers than the other data, within Namibia and across the Angolan and Zambian borders. Our results provide a framework for incorporating genetic data into malaria surveillance and provide evidence that both strengthening of local interventions and regional coordination are likely necessary to eliminate malaria in this region of Southern Africa.},

  abstract = {Background For malaria control in Africa it is crucial to characterise the dispersal of its most efficient vector, Anopheles gambiae, in order to target interventions and assess their impact spatially. Our study is, we believe, the first to present a statistical model of dispersal probability against distance from breeding habitat to human settlements for this important disease vector. Methods/Principal Findings We undertook post-hoc analyses of mosquito catches made in The Gambia to derive statistical dispersal functions for An. gambiae sensu lato collected in 48 villages at varying distances to alluvial larval habitat along the River Gambia. The proportion dispersing declined exponentially with distance, and we estimated that 90\% of movements were within 1.7 km. Although a ‘heavy-tailed’ distribution is considered biologically more plausible due to active dispersal by mosquitoes seeking blood meals, there was no statistical basis for choosing it over a negative exponential distribution. Using a simple random walk model with daily survival and movements previously recorded in Burkina Faso, we were able to reproduce the dispersal probabilities observed in The Gambia. Conclusions/Significance Our results provide an important quantification of the probability of An. gambiae s.l. dispersal in a rural African setting typical of many parts of the continent. However, dispersal will be landscape specific and in order to generalise to other spatial configurations of habitat and hosts it will be necessary to produce tractable models of mosquito movements for operational use. We show that simple random walk models have potential. Consequently, there is a pressing need for new empirical studies of An. gambiae survival and movements in different settings to drive this development.},

Gene IBD is traced through ancestral meioses and is defined relative to founders of a pedigree, or to some time point or mutational origin in the coalescent of a set of extant genes in a population. The random process underlying changes in the patterns of IBD across the genome is recombination, so the natural context for defining IBD is the ancestral recombination graph (ARG), which specifies the complete ancestry of a collection of chromosomes. The ARG determines both the sequence of coalescent ancestries across the chromosome and the extant segments of DNA descending unbroken by recombination from their most recent common ancestor (MRCA). DNA segments IBD from a recent common ancestor have high probability of being of the same allelic type. Non-IBD DNA is modeled as of independent allelic type, but the population frame of reference for defining allelic independence can vary. Whether of IBD, allelic similarity, or phenotypic covariance, comparisons may be made to other genomic regions of the same gametes, or to the same genomic regions in other sets of gametes or diploid individuals. In this review, I present IBD as the framework connecting evolutionary and coalescent theory with the analysis of genetic data observed on individuals. I focus on the high variance of the processes that determine IBD, its changes across the genome, and its impact on observable data.},

  abstract = {Daily, or more frequent, maps of surface water have important applications in environmental and water resource management. In particular, surface water maps derived from remote sensing imagery play a useful role in the derivation of spatial inundation patterns over time. MODIS data provide the most realistic means to achieve this since they are daily, although they are often limited by cloud cover during flooding events, and their spatial resolutions (250–1000 m pixel) are not always suited to small river catchments. This paper tests the suitability of the MODIS sensor for identifying flood events through comparison with streamflow and rainfall measurements at a number of sites during the wet season in Northern Australia. This is done using the MODIS Open Water Likelihood (OWL) algorithm which estimates the water fraction within a pixel. On a temporal scale, cloud cover often inhibits the use of MODIS imagery at the start and lead-up to the peak of a flood event, but there are usually more cloud-free data to monitor the flood’s recession. Particularly for smaller flood events, the MODIS view angle, especially when the view angle is towards the sun, has a strong influence on total estimated flood extent. Our results showed that removing pixels containing less than 6\% water can eliminate most commission errors when mapping surface water. The exception to this rule was for some spectrally dark pixels occurring along the edge of the MODIS swath where the relative azimuth angle (i.e., angle between the MODIS’ and sun’s azimuth angle) was low. Using only MODIS OWL pixels with a low view angle, or a range distance of less than 1000 km, also improves the results and minimizes multi-temporal errors in flood identification and extent. Given these limitations, MODIS OWL surface water maps are sensitive to the dynamics of water movement when compared to streamflow data and does appear to be a suitable product for the identification and mapping of inundation extent at large regional/basin scales.},

  abstract = {Human mobility is a key component of large-scale spatial-transmission models of infectious diseases. Correctly modeling and quantifying human mobility is critical for improving epidemic control, but may be hindered by data incompleteness or unavailability. Here we explore the opportunity of using proxies for individual mobility to describe commuting flows and predict the diffusion of an influenza-like-illness epidemic. We consider three European countries and the corresponding commuting networks at different resolution scales, obtained from (i) official census surveys, (ii) proxy mobility data extracted from mobile phone call records, and (iii) the radiation model calibrated with census data. Metapopulation models defined on these countries and integrating the different mobility layers are compared in terms of epidemic observables. We show that commuting networks from mobile phone data capture the empirical commuting patterns well, accounting for more than 87\% of the total fluxes. The distributions of commuting fluxes per link from mobile phones and census sources are similar and highly correlated, however a systematic overestimation of commuting traffic in the mobile phone data is observed. This leads to epidemics that spread faster than on census commuting networks, once the mobile phone commuting network is considered in the epidemic model, however preserving to a high degree the order of infection of newly affected locations. Proxies' calibration affects the arrival times' agreement across different models, and the observed topological and traffic discrepancies among mobility sources alter the resulting epidemic invasion patterns. Results also suggest that proxies perform differently in approximating commuting patterns for disease spread at different resolution scales, with the radiation model showing higher accuracy than mobile phone data when the seed is central in the network, the opposite being observed for peripheral locations. Proxies should therefore be chosen in light of the desired accuracy for the epidemic situation under study.},

  abstract = {Using mathematical modelling tools, we assessed the potential for land use change (LUC) associated with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change low- and high-end emission scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) to impact malaria transmission in Africa. To drive a spatially explicit, dynamical malaria model, data from the four available earth system models (ESMs) that contributed to the LUC experiment of the Fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project are used. Despite the limited size of the ESM ensemble, stark differences in the assessment of how LUC can impact climate are revealed. In three out of four ESMs, the impact of LUC on precipitation and temperature over the next century is limited, resulting in no significant change in malaria transmission. However, in one ESM, LUC leads to increases in precipitation under scenario RCP2.6, and increases in temperature in areas of land use conversion to farmland under both scenarios. The result is a more intense transmission and longer transmission seasons in the southeast of the continent, most notably in Mozambique and southern Tanzania. In contrast, warming associated with LUC in the Sahel region reduces risk in this model, as temperatures are already above the 25-30 degrees C threshold at which transmission peaks. The differences between the ESMs emphasise the uncertainty in such assessments. It is also recalled that the modelling framework is unable to adequately represent local-scale changes in climate due to LUC, which some field studies indicate could be significant.},

  abstract = {Malaria remains a major public health problem in many countries. Unlike influenza and HIV, where diversity in immunodominant surface antigens is understood geographically to inform disease surveillance, relatively little is known about the global population structure of PfEMP1, the major variant surface antigen of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The complexity of the var multigene family that encodes PfEMP1 and that diversifies by recombination, has so far precluded its use in malaria surveillance. Recent studies have demonstrated that cost-effective deep sequencing of the region of var genes encoding the PfEMP1 DBLα domain and subsequent classification of within host sequences at 96\% identity to define unique DBLα types, can reveal structure and strain dynamics within countries. However, to date there has not been a comprehensive comparison of these DBLα types between countries. By leveraging a bioinformatic approach (jumping hidden Markov model) designed specifically for the analysis of recombination within var genes and applying it to a dataset of DBLα types from 10 countries, we are able to describe population structure of DBLα types at the global scale. The sensitivity of the approach allows for the comparison of the global dataset to ape samples of Plasmodium Laverania species. Our analyses show that the evolution of the parasite population emerging out of Africa underlies current patterns of DBLα type diversity. Most importantly, we can distinguish geographic population structure within Africa between Gabon and Ghana in West Africa and Uganda in East Africa. Our evolutionary findings have translational implications in the context of globalization. Firstly, DBLα type diversity can provide a simple diagnostic framework for geographic surveillance of the rapidly evolving transmission dynamics of P. falciparum. It can also inform efforts to understand the presence or absence of global, regional and local population immunity to major surface antigen variants. Additionally, we identify a number of highly conserved DBLα types that are present globally that may be of biological significance and warrant further characterization.},

  abstract = {Background Malaria is rampant in Africa and causes untold mortality and morbidity. Vector-borne diseases are climate sensitive and this has raised considerable concern over the implications of climate change on future disease risk. The problem of malaria vectors (Anopheles mosquitoes) shifting from their traditional locations to invade new zones is an important concern. The vision of this study was to exploit the sets of information previously generated by entomologists, e.g. on geographical range of vectors and malaria distribution, to build models that will enable prediction and mapping the potential redistribution of Anopheles mosquitoes in Africa. Methods The development of the modelling tool was carried out through calibration of CLIMEX parameters. The model helped estimate the potential geographical distribution and seasonal abundance of the species in relation to climatic factors. These included temperature, rainfall and relative humidity, which characterized the living environment for Anopheles mosquitoes. The same parameters were used in determining the ecoclimatic index (EI). The EI values were exported to a GIS package for special analysis and proper mapping of the potential future distribution of Anopheles gambiae and Anophles arabiensis within the African continent under three climate change scenarios. Results These results have shown that shifts in these species boundaries southward and eastward of Africa may occur rather than jumps into quite different climatic environments. In the absence of adequate control, these predictions are crucial in understanding the possible future geographical range of the vectors and the disease, which could facilitate planning for various adaptation options. Conclusion Thus, the outputs from this study will be helpful at various levels of decision making, for example, in setting up of an early warning and sustainable strategies for climate change and climate change adaptation for malaria vectors control programmes in Africa.},

Determination of MOI and diversity of P. falciparum among asymptomatic carriers will enhance our understanding of parasite biology and transmission to mosquito vectors. This study examined the MOI and genetic diversity of P. falciparum parasite populations circulating in Mbita, a region characterized as one of the malaria hotspots in Kenya. The genetic diversity and multiplicity of P. falciparum infections in 95 asymptomatic school children (age 5-15\,yrs.) residing in Mbita, western Kenya were assessed using 10 polymorphic microsatellite markers. An average of 79.69\% (Range: 54.84-95.74\%) of the isolates analysed in this study were polyclonal infections as detected in at least one locus. A high mean MOI of 3.39 (Range: 2.24-4.72) and expected heterozygosity (He) of 0.81 (Range: 0.57-0.95) was reported in the study population. The analysed samples were extensively polyclonal infections leading to circulation of highly genetically diverse parasite populations in the study area. These findings correlated with the expectations of high malaria transmission intensity despite scaling up malaria interventions in the area thereby indicating the need for a robust malaria interventions particularly against asymptomatic carriers in order to attain elimination in the region.},

  abstract = {Quantifying transmission intensity and heterogeneity is crucial to ascertain the threat posed by infectious diseases and inform the design of interventions. Methods that jointly estimate the reproduction number R and the dispersion parameter k have however mainly remained limited to the analysis of epidemiological clusters or contact tracing data, whose collection often proves difficult. Here, we show that clusters of identical sequences are imprinted by the pathogen offspring distribution, and we derive an analytical formula for the distribution of the size of these clusters. We develop and evaluate a novel inference framework to jointly estimate the reproduction number and the dispersion parameter from the size distribution of clusters of identical sequences. We then illustrate its application across a range of epidemiological situations. Finally, we develop a hypothesis testing framework relying on clusters of identical sequences to determine whether a given pathogen genetic subpopulation is associated with increased or reduced transmissibility. Our work provides new tools to estimate the reproduction number and transmission heterogeneity from pathogen sequences without building a phylogenetic tree, thus making it easily scalable to large pathogen genome datasets. Significance statement For many infectious diseases, a small fraction of individuals has been documented to disproportionately contribute to onward spread. Characterizing the extent of superspreading is a crucial step towards the implementation of efficient interventions. Despite its epidemiological relevance, it remains difficult to quantify transmission heterogeneity. Here, we present a novel inference framework harnessing the size of clusters of identical pathogen sequences to estimate the reproduction number and the dispersion parameter. We also show that the size of these clusters can be used to estimate the transmission advantage of a pathogen genetic variant. This work provides crucial new tools to better characterize the spread of pathogens and evaluate their control.},

The accuracy of the assessment is not highly expected inherently and, moreover, some costly and sophisticated tools (e.g., satellite images) have been usually involved without a careful consideration of their investment. In this paper, a novel approach has been proposed orienting to farmers (especially in Southeastern Asia) who are only affordable for low cost and easy-to-use tools. With this vision, the paper presents an idea to co-operate certain, powerful and modern technologies-deep neural networks (DNNs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-with respect to solving the problem of yield assessment. The imagery of paddy fields acquired by UAVs at low altitudes is then used for training DNNs and assessing the yield of the paddy fields. Four DNN models are applied to figure out the most appropriate one for this approach. To test the applicability of the proposed approach, some experiments are conducted on a dataset which was collected at paddy fields in Tay Ninh province, Vietnam. The yield assessment is not directly predicted from DNNs, instead being achieved by a combination of the classification results and a bush-level yield estimation of agricultural experts in the fields. The paper indicates that the proposed approach is quite potential for precision agriculture, along with some remaining challenges.},

  abstract = {The introduction of genomic methods facilitated standardized molecular disease surveillance. For instance, SNP barcodes in Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria allows the characterization of haplotypes, their frequencies and prevalence to reveal temporal and spatial transmission patterns. A confounding factor is the presence of multiple genetically distinct pathogen variants within the same infection, known as multiplicity of infection (MOI). Disregarding ambiguous information, as usually done in ad-hoc approaches, leads to less confident and biased estimates. We introduce a statistical framework to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates (MLE) of haplotype frequencies and prevalence alongside MOI from malaria SNP data, i.e., multiple biallelic marker loci. The number of model parameters increases geometrically with the number of genetic markers considered and no closed-form solution exists for the MLE. Therefore, the MLE needs to be derived numerically. We use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to derive the maximum-likelihood estimates, an efficient and easy-to-implement algorithm that yields a numerically stable solution. We also derive expressions for haplotype prevalence based on either all or just the unambiguous genetic information and compare both approaches. The latter corresponds to a biased ad-hoc estimate of prevalence. We assess the performance of our estimator by systematic numerical simulations assuming realistic sample sizes and various scenarios of transmission intensity. For reasonable sample sizes, and number of loci, the method has little bias. As an example, we apply the method to a dataset from Cameroon on sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in P. falciparum malaria. The method is not confined to malaria and can be applied to any infectious disease with similar transmission behavior. An easy-to-use implementation of the method as an R-script is provided.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many public health interventions lead to disruption or decrease of transmission, providing a beneficial effect for people in the population regardless of whether or not they individually participate in the intervention. This protective benefit has been referred to as a herd or community effect and is dependent on sufficient population participation. In practice, public health interventions are implemented at different spatial scales (i.e., at the village, district, or provincial level). Populations, however defined (i.e., neighbourhoods, villages, districts) are frequently connected to other populations through human movement or travel, and this connectedness can influence potential herd effects. METHODS: The impact of a public health intervention (mass drug administration for malaria) was modelled, for different levels of connectedness between populations that have similar disease epidemiology (e.g., two nearby villages which have similar baseline malaria incidences and similar malaria intervention measures), or between populations of varying disease epidemiology (e.g., two nearby villages which have different baseline malaria incidences and/or malaria intervention measures). RESULTS: The overall impact of the interventions deployed could be influenced either positively (adding value to the intervention) or negatively (reducing the impact of the intervention) by how much the intervention units are connected with each other (e.g., how frequent people go to the other village or town) and how different the disease intensity between them are. This phenomenon is termed the "assembly effect", and it is a meta-population version of the more commonly understood "herd effect". CONCLUSIONS: The connectedness of intervention units or populations is an important factor to be considered to achieve success in public health interventions that could provide herd effects. Appreciating the assembly effect can improve the cost-effective strategies for global disease elimination projects.},

For the unfiltered images, IKONOS XS provided the highest overall accuracies of 88.9\% and 88.1\% for the all-bands and the coincident bands classifications, respectively. On average, IKONOS XS performed slightly better than QuickBird XS and QuickBird PS, while it outperformed SPOT4 XS and SPOT5 XS. The use of filtered images in field-based classification reduced the accuracies for SPOT4 XS, SPOT5 XS, IKONOS XS and QuickBird XS. The results of this study indicate that smoothing images prior to classification does not improve the accuracies for the field-based classification. On the contrary, the accuracies for the filtered QuickBird PS images indicated a slight improvement. On the whole, both IKONOS and QuickBird images produced quite promising results for field-based crop mapping, yielding overall accuracies above 83\%.},

  abstract = {As malaria declines in parts of Africa and elsewhere, and as more countries move towards elimination, it is necessary to robustly evaluate the effect of interventions and control programmes on malaria transmission. To help guide the appropriate design of trials to evaluate transmission-reducing interventions, we review 11 metrics of malaria transmission, discussing their accuracy, precision, collection methods and costs and presenting an overall critique. We also review the nonlinear scaling relationships between five metrics of malaria transmission: the entomological inoculation rate, force of infection, sporozoite rate, parasite rate and the basic reproductive number, R0. Our chapter highlights that while the entomological inoculation rate is widely considered the gold standard metric of malaria transmission and may be necessary for measuring changes in transmission in highly endemic areas, it has limited precision and accuracy and more standardised methods for its collection are required. In areas of low transmission, parasite rate, seroconversion rates and molecular metrics including MOI and mFOI may be most appropriate. When assessing a specific intervention, the most relevant effects will be detected by examining the metrics most directly affected by that intervention. Future work should aim to better quantify the precision and accuracy of malaria metrics and to improve methods for their collection.},

  abstract = {Effective malaria control strategies require an accurate understanding of the epidemiology of locally transmitted Plasmodium species. Compared to Plasmodium falciparum infection, Plasmodium vivax has a lower asexual parasitaemia, forms dormant liver-stages (hypnozoites), and is more transmissible. Hence, treatment and diagnostic policies aimed exclusively at P. falciparum are far less efficient against endemic P. vivax. Within sub-Saharan Africa, malaria control programmes justly focus on reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with P. falciparum. However, the recent emphasis on malaria elimination and increased accessibility of more sensitive diagnostic tools have revealed greater intricacies in malaria epidemiology across the continent. Since 2010, the number of studies identifying P. vivax endemic to Africa has expanded considerably, with 88 new scientific reports published since a review of evidence in 2015, approximately doubling the available data. There is evidence of P. vivax in all regions of Africa, apparent from infected vectors, clinical cases, serological indicators, parasite prevalence, exported infections, and P. vivax-infected Duffy-negative individuals. Where the prevalence of microscopic parasitaemia is low, a greater proportion of P. vivax infections were observed relative to P. falciparum. This evidence highlights an underlying widespread presence of P. vivax across all malaria-endemic regions of Africa, further complicating the current practical understanding of malaria epidemiology in this region. Thus, ultimate elimination of malaria in Africa will require national malaria control programmes to adopt policy and practice aimed at all human species of malaria.},

  abstract = {In this study, new add-on bands in a multispectral dataset of WorldView-2, DigitalGlobe’s second next-generation satellite, have been evaluated. For extraction of a specific agriculture crop at a time, WorldView-2 multispectral single, as well as two-date data sets, were used. For this purpose, a class-based sensor independent spectral band ratio normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (CBSI-NDVI) and its possibilistice fuzzy classification approach was used. Different agriculture crops selected for the study were sugarcane, late wheat, cauliflower, berseem (fodder), early wheat and ratoon. It is found that bands four and eight with temporal data are good for extracting sugarcane, while bands four, eight and five, seven with temporal data are suitable for late wheat and bands four and eight work well for cauliflower. Similarly, bands five, seven and five, eight with temporal data are good for extracting berseem (fodder), bands four, eight work for early wheat with temporal data and for ratoon four, six single date or four, six and four, eight temporal data. This suitability of bands has been observed with respect to a maximum membership value difference, as well as maximum entropy difference, between the two closest agriculture crops. Thus, it can be concluded that existing bands five, seven and new bands four, six, eight in WorldView-2 are important for identifying and mapping crops mentioned in this study. This indicates new bands, especially four, six, eight introduced in WorldView-2, are more effective than existing bands in QuickBird for mapping specific crops.},

  abstract = {A new procedure is proposed for agricultural land-use mapping that addresses a known weakness of classical per-pixel methods in situations involving mixed tree crops. The proposed scheme uses a pair of very-high resolution satellite-borne panchromatic and multispectral images and integrates classification results of two parallel and independent analyses, respectively based on spectral and textural information. The multispectral image is divided into spectrally homogeneous but non-contiguous segments using unsupervised classification. In parallel, the panchromatic image is split into a grid of square blocks on which is performed a texture-driven supervised classification. Finally, the spectral and the textural classifications are fused to generate the land-use map. This method contrasts with object-based methods that sequentially perform image segmentation and classification. Results are evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, based on field survey ground-truth data. The quantitative assessment is presented in terms of overall accuracy (from 80\% to 100\% depending on the area) and Kappa coefficients. Visual comparison of the resulting map with the ground-truth is performed, with the analysis of the binary error maps. Merging spectral and textural classifications results in finer border delimitation and improves the overall classification accuracy of agricultural land-use by 27\% as compared to textural classification alone.},

This study aims to understand Plasmodium species distribution and the genetic diversity of msp1 and msp2 of parasite populations using molecular tools. METHODS: A total of 222 clinical isolates from individuals with uncomplicated malaria were subjected to Plasmodium species identification by nested real-time PCR. 166 isolates positive for Plasmodium falciparum mono infections were further genotyped for msp1 (MAD20, K1, and RO33), and msp2 allelic families (3D7 and FC27). Amplicons were resolved through capillary electrophoresis in the QIAxcel Advanced system. RESULTS: Mono-infections were high and with 75\% P. falciparum, 14\% Plasmodium vivax and 9\% P. falciparum/P. vivax co-infections, with less than 1\% Plasmodium malariae identified. For msp1, MAD20 was the most prevalent (99\%), followed by K1 (46\%) allelic family, with no sample testing positive for RO33 (0\%). For msp2, 3D7 allelic family was predominant (97\%), followed by FC27 (10\%). The multiplicity of infection of msp1 and msp2 was 2.6 and 1.1, respectively, and the mean overall multiplicity of infection was 3.7, with the total number of alleles ranging from 1 to 7. CONCLUSIONS: Given the increasing importance of antimalarial drugs in the region, the genetic diversity of P. falciparum msp1 and msp2 should be regularly monitored with respect to treatment outcomes and/or efficacy studies in regions, where there are ongoing changes in the malaria epidemiology.},

  abstract = {The Mekong is the longest river in southeast Asia. From its source on the Tibetan plateau it runs for 4,800 km through China, Myanmar, Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia and Viet Nam to the South China Sea, where it discharges on average 475,000 million m 3 per year. The total Mekong Basin (MB) catchment area covers 795,000 km2 and has 73 million inhabitants. The Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) comprises the four countries, - Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam - that signed the 1995 river development agreement and covers 77\{\%\} of the total basin with 55 million people. The degree of inundation of the 70,000 km2 floodplains depends on the strength of the monsoon, as 85-90 \{\%\} of the discharge is generated during the wet season from May to October. Although far from pristine, the river still is in a relative good condition. Only 2 mainstream dams (in China) have been built, but many more on the tributaries. The number of fish species that has been found in the MB exceeds 2000. Many migrate across international borders, thus constituting trans-boundary resources. The largest fisheries are found in the extensive floodplains in central Cambodia and the delta. A huge variety of fishing gear is used, from the most simple traps to kilometers-long fence systems. Catch levels of the capture fisheries in the LMB are estimated to top 2.6 million tons annually with a value exceeding US\{\$\} 1.7 billion. In Cambodia fisheries contribute 16\{\%\} to the GDP. Strong increases in human population are matched by equal increases in fishing effort resulting in catch levels that are probably higher than ever. Major declines in stock sizes of the larger later-in-life spawning species have been witnessed. Catches are now dominated by smaller rapidly reproducing species. Aquaculture is wide spread in the Thai and Viet Namese parts of the LMB; production is estimated at 260,000 t. In addition, 240,000 t are captured in reservoirs. In rural areas most people engage in fishing to generate part of their income and food supply. The basin-wide consumption of fish and other aquatic animals ranges from 42 - 66 kg/capita/year. The Mekong River Commission came into being with the signing of the 1995 agreement by Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam. It focuses on the need for cooperation in the sustainable development of the LMB. China and Myanmar have not joined yet. The member nations have agreed to prior consultation on proposed river water usage. The most important interventions required to sustain the fisheries are: (1) Strengthening of the capacity of riparian governments in coordination and balanced decision-making on water resources development; (2) Setting up of consultation procedures on water resources and fisheries management with resource users, decision makers, researchers and donors; (3) Collection of data clarifying the contribution of fisheries to the national economy, food security and livelihoods; (4) Participation of resource users in fisheries management; (5) Protection of floodplain habitats; (6) Maintenance of highest possible flood levels and a free flowing mainstream with as many free tributaries as possible.},

The impacts were simulated by a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model using the projected changes in sea level and the Mekong mainstream discharge under the influence of climate change as boundary conditions. The model simulations projected that average and maximum water levels and flood duration increase in 2010-2049. The most consistent and notable changes occurred in the average and dry hydrological years. Sea level rise had the greatest effects in the Mekong Delta, whereas the impacts of changed basin water balance were more notable in the upper areas of the Mekong floodplains. The projected impacts were mostly opposite to those resulting from regional water infrastructure development. Higher and longer flooding could cause damage to crops, infrastructure and floodplain vegetation, and decrease the fertile land area. On the other hand, it might boost ecosystem productivity and enhance dry season water availability.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of very high spatial resolution (VHSR) Pléiades images to both early season crop identification and the mapping of bare soil surface characteristics due to cultural operations. The study region covering 21km2is located west of the peri-urban territory of the Versailles plain and the Alluets plateau (Yvelines, France). About 100 cropped fields were observed on the ground synchronously with two Pléiades images of 3 and 24 April 2013 and one SPOT4 image of 2 April 2013. The GIS structuring of these field data along with vector information about field boundaries was used for delimitating both training and test zones for the support vector machine classifier with polynomial function kernel (pSVM). The pSVM was computed on the spectral bands and NDVI for both single-date Pléiades and the bi-temporal Pléiades pair. For the single-date classifications of crops, the overall per-pixel accuracy reached 87\% for the SPOT4 image of 2 April (6 classes), 79\% for the Pléiades image of 3 April (6 classes) and 82\% for that of 24 April (7 classes). At the earlier date (2-3 April), the Pléiades image very well discriminated cultural operations ({$>$}77\%, user's or producer's accuracies) as well as fallows and grasslands, while winter cereals and rapeseed were better discriminated by the SPOT4 image winter cereals ({$>$}70\%, user's or producer's accuracies). As Pléiades images revealed withinfield spatial variations of early phenological stages of winter cereals that could be critical for adjusting management of zones with delayed development during the growing season, they brought information complementary to multispectral images with high spatial resolution. For the bi-temporal Pléiades image, the overall per-pixel accuracy was about 80\% (7 classes), winter crops, grasslands and fallows being very well detected while confusions occurred between spring barley at initial stages (2-3 leaves) and bare soils prepared for other spring crops. Using an additional validation field set covering \textasciitilde 1/3 of the study area croplands, the crop map resulting from the bi-temporal Pléiades pair achieved correct crop prediction for about 89.7\% of the validation fields when considering composite classes for winter cereals and for spring crops. Early-season Pléiades images therefore show a considerable potential for anticipating regional crop patterns and detecting soil tillage operations in spring.},

  abstract = {A key quantity in the analysis of structured populations is the parameter K, which describes the number of subpopulations that make up the total population. Inference of K ideally proceeds via the model evidence, which is equivalent to the likelihood of the model. However, the evidence in favor of a particular value of K cannot usually be computed exactly, and instead programs such as Structure make use of heuristic estimators to approximate this quantity. We show-using simulated data sets small enough that the true evidence can be computed exactly-that these heuristics often fail to estimate the true evidence and that this can lead to incorrect conclusions about K Our proposed solution is to use thermodynamic integration (TI) to estimate the model evidence. After outlining the TI methodology we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, using a range of simulated data sets. We find that TI can be used to obtain estimates of the model evidence that are more accurate and precise than those based on heuristics. Furthermore, estimates of K based on these values are found to be more reliable than those based on a suite of model comparison statistics. Finally, we test our solution in a reanalysis of a white-footed mouse data set. The TI methodology is implemented for models both with and without admixture in the software MavericK1.0.},

Conversely, detecting locus-specific effects may help identify those genes that have been, or still are, targeted by natural selection. The software package DETSEL has been developed to identify markers that show deviation from neutral expectation in pairwise comparisons of diverging populations. Recently, two major improvements have been made: the analysis of dominant markers is now supported, and the estimation of empirical P-values has been implemented. These features, which are described below, have been incorporated into an R package, which replaces the stand-alone DETSEL software package.},

As it is technically and financially impossible to conserve all landscapes affected by erosion, identification of priority areas of intervention is necessary. Spatially distributed erosion models can help map landscape susceptibility to erosion and identify high erosion risk areas. Integration of erosion models with geographic information systems (GIS) enables assessing evaluate the spatial variability of soil erosion and plan implementing conservation measures at landscape levels. In this study, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation adjusted for sediment delivery ratio was used in a GIS system to assess landscape sensitivity to erosion and identify hotspots. The approach was applied in three catchments with size being 10–20~km2and results were compared against quantitative and semi-quantitative data. The model estimated mean soil loss rates of about 45~t~ha−1~y−1with an average variability of 30\% between catchments. The estimated soil loss rate is above the tolerable limit of 10~t~ha−1~y−1. The model predicted high soil loss rates at steep slopes and shoulder positions as well as along gullies. The results of the study demonstrate that knowledge of spatial patterns of high soil loss risk areas can help deploy site-specific conservation measures.},

We identified multiple regions with signatures of selective sweeps in drug-resistant parasites, including a previously unidentified 160-kb region with extremely low polymorphism in pyrimethamine-resistant parasites. We further characterized 54 worldwide isolates by genotyping SNPs across 20 genomic regions. These data begin to define population structure among African, Asian and American groups and illustrate the degree of linkage disequilibrium, which extends over relatively short distances in African parasites but over longer distances in Asian parasites.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The application of remote sensing methods to assess crop vigor and yields has had limited applications in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) due largely to limitations associated with satellite images. The increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles in recent times opens up new possibilities for remotely sensing crop status and yields even on complex smallholder farms. This study demonstrates the applicability of a vegetation index derived from UAV imagery to assess maize (Zea mays L.) crop vigor and yields at various stages of crop growth. The study employs a quadcopter flown at 100 m over farm plots and equipped with two consumer-grade cameras, one of which is modified to capture images in the near infrared. We find that UAV-derived GNDVI is a better indicator of crop vigor and a better estimator of yields—r = 0.372 and r = 0.393 for mean and maximum GNDVI respectively at about five weeks after planting compared to in-field methods like SPAD readings at the same stage (r = 0.259). Our study therefore demonstrates that GNDVI derived from UAV imagery is a reliable and timeous predictor of crop vigor and yields and that this is applicable even in complex smallholder farms in SSA.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Spatial land use information is one of the key input parameters for regional agro-ecosystem modeling. Furthermore, to assess the crop-specific management in a spatio-temporal context accurately, parcel-related crop rotation information is additionally needed. Such data is scarcely available for a regional scale, so that only modeled crop rotations can be incorporated instead. However, the spectrum of the occurring multiannual land use patterns on arable land remains unknown. Thus, this contribution focuses on the mapping of the actually practiced crop rotations in the Rur catchment, located in the western part of Germany. We addressed this by combining multitemporal multispectral remote sensing data, ancillary information and expert-knowledge on crop phenology in a GIS-based Multi-Data Approach (MDA). At first, a methodology for the enhanced differentiation of the major crop types on an annual basis was developed. Key aspects are (i) the usage of physical block data to separate arable land from other land use types, (ii) the classification of remote sensing scenes of specific time periods, which are most favorable for the differentiation of certain crop types, and (iii) the combination of the multitemporal classification results in a sequential analysis strategy. Annual crop maps of eight consecutive years (2008–2015) were combined to a crop sequence dataset to have a profound data basis for the mapping of crop rotations. In most years, the remote sensing data basis was highly fragmented. Nevertheless, our method enabled satisfying crop mapping results. As an example for the annual crop mapping workflow, the procedure and the result of 2015 are illustrated. For the generation of the crop sequence dataset, the eight annual crop maps were geometrically smoothened and integrated into a single vector data layer. The resulting dataset informs about the occurring crop sequence for individual areas on arable land, so that crop rotation schemes can be derived. The resulting dataset reveals that the spectrum of the practiced crop rotations is extremely heterogeneous and contains a large amount of crop sequences, which strongly diverge from model crop rotations. Consequently, the integration of remote sensing-based crop rotation data can considerably reduce uncertainties regarding the management in regional agro-ecosystem modeling. Finally, the developed methods and the results are discussed in detail.},

Both of these models produce spatial dependence in the covariance structure as a function of a neighbor matrix W and often a fixed unknown spatial correlation parameter. This paper examines in detail the correlation structures implied by these models as applied to an irregular lattice in an attempt to demonstrate their many counterintuitive or impractical results.

In the last twenty or so years the incidence of malaria has been aggravated by the resurgence of highland malaria epidemics which hitherto had been rare. A close association between malaria epidemics and climate variability has been reported but not universally accepted. Similarly, the relationship between climate variability, intensity of disease mortality and morbidity coupled with socio-economic factors has been mooted. Analyses of past climate (temperature and precipitation), hydrological and health data (1961–2001), and socio-economics status of communities from the East African highlands confirm the link between climate variability and the incidence and severity of malaria epidemics. The communities in the highlands that have had less exposure to malaria are more vulnerable than their counterparts in the lowlands due to lack of clinical immunity. However, the vulnerability of human health to climate variability is influenced by the coping and adaptive capacities of an individual or community. Surveys conducted among three communities in the East African highlands reveal that the interplay of poverty and other socio-economic variables have intensified the vulnerability of these communities to the impacts of malaria.},

Ecological and geographic variables can contribute to genetic structure through geographic isolation, in which geographic barriers and distances restrict gene flow, and ecological isolation, in which gene flow among populations inhabiting different environments is limited by selection against dispersers moving between them. Although methods have been developed to study geographic isolation in detail, ecological isolation has received much less attention, partly because disentangling the effects of these mechanisms is inherently difficult. Here, I describe a novel approach for quantifying the effects of geographic and ecological isolation using multiple matrix regression with randomization. I explored the parameter space over which this method is effective using a series of individual-based simulations and found that it accurately describes the effects of geographic and ecological isolation over a wide range of conditions. I also applied this method to a set of real-world datasets to show that ecological isolation is an often overlooked but important contributor to patterns of spatial genetic variation and to demonstrate how this analysis can provide new insights into how landscapes contribute to the evolution of genetic variation in nature.},

  abstract = {Defining the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) has been extremely controversial. This paper elaborates on the meanings of 25 existing EASM indices in terms of two observed major modes of interannual variation in the precipitation and circulation anomalies for the 1979-2006 period. The existing indices can be classified into five categories: the east-west thermal contrast, north-south thermal contrast, shear vorticity of zonal winds, southwesterly monsoon, and South China Sea monsoon. The last four types of indices reflect various aspects of the leading mode of interannual variability of the EASM rainfall and circulations, which correspond to the decaying El Nino, while the first category reflects the second mode that corresponds to the developing El Nino. The authors recommend that the EASM strength can be represented by the principal component of the leading mode of the interannual variability, which provides a unified index for the majority of the existing indices. This new index is extremely robust, captures a large portion (50\%) of the total variance of the precipitation and three-dimensional circulation, and has unique advantages over all the existing indices. The authors also recommend a simple index, the reversed Wang and Fan index, which is nearly identical to the leading principal component of the EASM and greatly facilitates real-time monitoring. The proposed index highlights the significance of the mei-yu/baiu/changma rainfall in gauging the strength of the EASM. The mei-yu, which is produced in the primary rain-bearing system, the East Asian (EA) subtropical front, better represents the variability of the EASM circulation system. This new index reverses the traditional Chinese meaning of a strong EASM, which corresponds to a deficient mei-yu that is associated with an abnormal northward extension of southerly over northern China. The new definition is consistent with the meaning used in other monsoon regions worldwide, where abundant rainfall within the major local rain-bearing monsoon system is considered to be a strong monsoon.},

  abstract = {The interactions between organisms and their environments can shape distributions of spatial genetic variation, resulting in patterns of isolation by environment (IBE) in which genetic and environmental distances are positively correlated, independent of geographic distance. IBE represents one of the most important patterns that results from the ways in which landscape heterogeneity influences gene flow and population connectivity, but it has only recently been examined in studies of ecological and landscape genetics. Nevertheless, the study of IBE presents valuable opportunities to investigate how spatial heterogeneity in ecological processes, agents of selection and environmental variables contributes to genetic divergence in nature. New and increasingly sophisticated studies of IBE in natural systems are poised to make significant contributions to our understanding of the role of ecology in genetic divergence and of modes of differentiation both within and between species. Here, we describe the underlying ecological processes that can generate patterns of IBE, examine its implications for a wide variety of disciplines and outline several areas of future research that can answer pressing questions about the ecological basis of genetic diversity.},

  abstract = {Kinship estimation is necessary for evaluating violations of assumptions or testing certain hypotheses in many population genomic studies. However, kinship estimators are usually designed for diploid systems and cannot be used in populations with mixed haploid diploid genetic systems. The only estimators for different ploidies require datasets free of population structure, limiting their usage.We present KIMGENS (Kinship Inference for Mixed GENetic Systems), an estimator for kinship estimation among individuals of various ploidies, that is robust to population structure. This estimator is based on the popular KING-robust estimator but uses diploid relatives of the individuals of interest as references of heterozygosity and extends its use to haploid–diploid and haploid pairs of individuals. We demonstrate that KIMGENS estimates kinship more accurately than previously developed estimators in simulated panmictic, structured and admixed populations, but has lower accuracy when the individual of interest is inbred. KIMGENS also outperforms other estimators in a honeybee dataset. Therefore, KIMGENS is a valuable addition to a population geneticist’s toolbox.KIMGENS and its association simulation tool are implemented and available open-source at https://github.com/YenWenWang/HapDipKinship.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Topographically correcting distances to account for the total overland distance between locations imposed by topographic relief provides one method for calculating geographic distances that account for landscape structure. Here, I present topoDistance, an r package for calculating shortest topographic distances, weighted topographic paths and topographic least cost paths (LCPs). Topographic distances are calculated by weighting the edges of a graph by the hypotenuse of the horizontal and vertical distances between raster cells and then finding the shortest total path between cells of interest. The package also includes tools for mapping topographic paths and plotting elevation profiles. Examples from a species with moderate dispersal abilities, the western fence lizard, inhabiting a topographically complex landscape, Yosemite National Park (USA), demonstrate that topographic distances can vary significantly from straight-line distances, and topographic LCPs can trace very different routes from LCPs and shortest topographic paths. Topographic paths and distances are broadly useful for modelling geographic isolation resulting from dispersal limitation for organisms that interact with the topographic structure of a landscape during movement and dispersal.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria in the western Kenya highlands is characterized by unstable and high transmission variability which results in epidemics during periods of suitable climatic conditions. The sensitivity of a site to malaria epidemics depends on the level of immunity of the human population. This study examined how terrain in the highlands affects exposure and sensitivity of a site to malaria. METHODS: The study was conducted in five sites in the western Kenya highlands, two U-shaped valleys (Iguhu, Emutete), two V-shaped valleys (Marani, Fort-Ternan) and one plateau (Shikondi) for 16 months among 6-15 years old children. Exposure to malaria was tested using circum-sporozoite protein (CSP) and merozoite surface protein (MSP) immunochromatographic antibody tests; malaria infections were tested by microscopic examination of thick and thin smears, the children's homes were georeferenced using a global positioning system. Paired t-test was used to compare the mean prevalence rates of the sites, K-function was use to determine if the clustering of malaria infections was significant. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The mean antibody prevalence was 22.6\% in Iguhu, 24\% in Emutete, 11.5\% in Shikondi, 8.3\% in Fort-Ternan and 9.3\% in Marani. The mean malaria infection prevalence was 23.3\% in Iguhu, 21.9\% in Emutete, 4.7\% in Shikondi, 2.9\% in Fort-Ternan and 2.4\% in Marani. There was a significant difference in the antibodies and malaria infection prevalence between the two valley systems, and between the two valley systems and the plateau (P {$<$} 0.05). There was no significant difference in the antibodies and malaria infection prevalence in the two U-shaped valleys (Iguhu and Emutete) and in the V-shaped valleys (Marani and Fort Ternan) (P {$>$} 0.05). There was 8.5- fold and a 2-fold greater parasite and antibody prevalence respectively, in the U-shaped compared to the V-shaped valleys. The plateau antibody and parasite prevalence was similar to that of the V-shaped valleys. There was clustering of malaria antibodies and infections around flat areas in the U-shaped valleys, the infections were randomly distributed in the V-shaped valleys and less clustered at the plateau. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the V-shaped ecosystems have very low malaria prevalence and few individuals with an immune response to two major malaria antigens and they can be considered as epidemic hotspots. These populations are at higher risk of severe forms of malaria during hyper-transmission seasons. The plateau ecosystem has a similar infection and immune response to the V-shaped ecosystems. The U-shaped ecosystems are transmission hotspots.},

However, the highest spatial resolution imagery typically has only a single spectral bond, and therefore, classification based on spatial patterns is required. One application particularly suited to spatial classification is the identification of orchards and vineyards. Orchards and vineyards have a distinctive repeating pattern that can be identified by an analysis of local autocorrelation patterns. A classification algorithm based on an analysis of autocorrelograms was developed, and tested using Ikonos panchromatic imagery of Granger, Washington. The spatial autocorrelation-based classification resulted in an estimated accuracy of 0.954 and kappa of 0.900. Errors of omission for orchards and vineyards were slightly higher than errors of commission (11-14 percent versus 3-6 percent). By comparison, a maximum likelihood classification of 32 gray level co-occurrence texture bands had a lower accuracy (0.865), with a kappa of 0.701, and errors of omission and commission as high as 35 percent and 57 percent, respectively.},

  abstract = {Genetic surveillance of malaria parasites supports malaria control programmes, treatment guidelines and elimination strategies. Surveillance studies often pose questions about malaria parasite ancestry (e.g. how antimalarial resistance has spread) and employ statistical methods that characterise parasite population structure. Many of the methods used to characterise structure are unsupervised machine learning algorithms which depend on a genetic distance matrix, notably principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC). PCoA and HAC are sensitive to both the definition of genetic distance and algorithmic specification. Importantly, neither algorithm infers malaria parasite ancestry. As such, PCoA and HAC can inform (e.g. via exploratory data visualisation and hypothesis generation), but not answer comprehensively, key questions about malaria parasite ancestry. We illustrate the sensitivity of PCoA and HAC using 393 Plasmodium falciparum whole genome sequences collected from Cambodia and neighbouring regions (where antimalarial resistance has emerged and spread recently) and we provide tentative guidance for the use and interpretation of PCoA and HAC in malaria parasite genetic epidemiology. This guidance includes a call for fully transparent and reproducible analysis pipelines that feature (i) a clearly outlined scientific question; (ii) a clear justification of analytical methods used to answer the scientific question along with discussion of any inferential limitations; (iii) publicly available genetic distance matrices when downstream analyses depend on them; and (iv) sensitivity analyses. To bridge the inferential disconnect between the output of non-inferential unsupervised learning algorithms and the scientific questions of interest, tailor-made statistical models are needed to infer malaria parasite ancestry. In the absence of such models speculative reasoning should feature only as discussion but not as results.},

One approach is to harness genetic sequencing and accompanying methodological approaches as have been used in the control of other infectious diseases. However, to utilize these methodologies for malaria, we first need to extend the methods to capture the complex interactions between parasites, human and vector hosts, and environment, which all impact the level of genetic diversity and relatedness of malaria parasites. We develop an individual-based transmission model to simulate malaria parasite genetics parameterized using estimated relationships between complexity of infection and age from five regions in Uganda and Kenya. We predict that cotransmission and superinfection contribute equally to within-host parasite genetic diversity at 11.5\% PCR prevalence, above which superinfections dominate. Finally, we characterize the predictive power of six metrics of parasite genetics for detecting changes in transmission intensity, before grouping them in an ensemble statistical model. The model predicted malaria prevalence with a mean absolute error of 0.055. Different assumptions about the availability of sample metadata were considered, with the most accurate predictions of malaria prevalence made when the clinical status and age of sampled individuals is known. Parasite genetics may provide a novel surveillance tool for estimating the prevalence of malaria in areas in which prevalence surveys are not feasible. However, the findings presented here reinforce the need for patient metadata to be recorded and made available within all future attempts to use parasite genetics for surveillance.},

Quantifying access to care globally is challenging due to the absence of a comprehensive database of healthcare facilities. We harness major data collection efforts underway by OpenStreetMap, Google Maps and academic researchers to compile the most complete collection of facility locations to date. Leveraging the geographically variable strengths of our facility datasets, we use an established methodology4 to characterize travel time to healthcare facilities in unprecedented detail. We produce maps of travel time with and without access to motorized transport, thus characterizing travel time to healthcare for populations distributed across the wealth spectrum. We find that just 8.9\% of the global population (646 million people) cannot reach healthcare within one hour if they have access to motorized transport, and that 43.3\% (3.16 billion people) cannot reach a healthcare facility by foot within one hour. Our maps highlight an additional vulnerability faced by poorer individuals in remote areas and can help to estimate whether individuals will seek healthcare when it is needed, as well as providing an evidence base for efficiently distributing limited healthcare and transportation resources to underserved populations both now and in the future.},

  abstract = {The economic and man-made resources that sustain human wellbeing are not distributed evenly across the world, but are instead heavily concentrated in cities. Poor access to opportunities and services offered by urban centres (a function of distance, transport infrastructure, and the spatial distribution of cities) is a major barrier to improved livelihoods and overall development. Advancing accessibility worldwide underpins the equity agenda of ‘leaving no one behind’ established by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations1. This has renewed international efforts to accurately measure accessibility and generate a metric that can inform the design and implementation of development policies. The only previous attempt to reliably map accessibility worldwide, which was published nearly a decade ago2, predated the baseline for the Sustainable Development Goals and excluded the recent expansion in infrastructure networks, particularly in lower-resource settings. In parallel, new data sources provided by Open Street Map and Google now capture transportation networks with unprecedented detail and precision. Here we develop and validate a map that quantifies travel time to cities for 2015 at a spatial resolution of approximately one by one kilometre by integrating ten global-scale surfaces that characterize factors affecting human movement rates and 13,840 high-density urban centres within an established geospatial-modelling framework. Our results highlight disparities in accessibility relative to wealth as 50.9\% of individuals living in low-income settings (concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa) reside within an hour of a city compared to 90.7\% of individuals in high-income settings. By further triangulating this map against socioeconomic datasets, we demonstrate how access to urban centres stratifies the economic, educational, and health status of humanity.},

  abstract = {Background Since 2000, the scale-up of malaria control interventions has substantially reduced morbidity and mortality caused by the disease globally, fuelling bold aims for disease elimination. In tandem with increased availability of geospatially resolved data, malaria control programmes increasingly use high-resolution maps to characterise spatially heterogeneous patterns of disease risk and thus efficiently target areas of high burden. Methods We updated and refined the Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate and clinical incidence models for sub-Saharan Africa, which rely on cross-sectional survey data for parasite rate and intervention coverage. For malaria endemic countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa, we produced estimates of parasite rate and incidence by applying an ecological downscaling approach to malaria incidence data acquired via routine surveillance. Mortality estimates were derived by linking incidence to systematically derived vital registration and verbal autopsy data. Informed by high-resolution covariate surfaces, we estimated P falciparum parasite rate, clinical incidence, and mortality at national, subnational, and 5\hphantom{,}×\hphantom{,}5 km pixel scales with corresponding uncertainty metrics. Findings We present the first global, high-resolution map of P falciparum malaria mortality and the first global prevalence and incidence maps since 2010. These results are combined with those for Plasmodium vivax (published separately) to form the malaria estimates for the Global Burden of Disease 2017 study. The P falciparum estimates span the period 2000–17, and illustrate the rapid decline in burden between 2005 and 2017, with incidence declining by 27·9\% and mortality declining by 42·5\%. Despite a growing population in endemic regions, P falciparum cases declined between 2005 and 2017, from 232·3 million (95\% uncertainty interval 198·8–277·7) to 193·9 million (156·6–240·2) and deaths declined from 925\hphantom{,}800 (596\hphantom{,}900–1\hphantom{,}341\hphantom{,}100) to 618\hphantom{,}700 (368\hphantom{,}600–952\hphantom{,}200). Despite the declines in burden, 90·1\% of people within sub-Saharan Africa continue to reside in endemic areas, and this region accounted for 79·4\% of cases and 87·6\% of deaths in 2017. Interpretation High-resolution maps of P falciparum provide a contemporary resource for informing global policy and malaria control planning, programme implementation, and monitoring initiatives. Amid progress in reducing global malaria burden, areas where incidence trends have plateaued or increased in the past 5 years underscore the fragility of hard-won gains against malaria. Efforts towards elimination should be strengthened in such areas, and those where burden remained high throughout the study period. Funding Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent global progress in scaling up malaria control interventions has revived the goal of complete elimination in many countries. Decreasing transmission intensity generally leads to increasingly patchy spatial patterns of malaria transmission in elimination settings, with control programs having to accurately identify remaining foci in order to efficiently target interventions. FINDINGS: The role of connectivity between different pockets of local transmission is of increasing importance as programs near elimination since humans are able to transfer parasites beyond the limits of mosquito dispersal, thus re-introducing parasites to previously malaria-free regions. Here, we discuss recent advances in the quantification of spatial epidemiology of malaria, particularly Plasmodium falciparum, in the context of transmission reduction interventions. Further, we highlight the challenges and promising directions for the development of integrated mapping, modeling, and genomic approaches that leverage disparate datasets to measure both connectivity and transmission. CONCLUSION: A more comprehensive understanding of the spatial transmission of malaria can be gained using a combination of parasite genetics and epidemiological modeling and mapping. However, additional molecular and quantitative methods are necessary to answer these public health-related questions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many problems in comparative biology are, or are thought to be, best expressed as phylogenetic "networks" as opposed to trees. In trees, vertices may have only a single parent (ancestor), while networks allow for multiple parent vertices. There are two main interpretive types of networks, "softwired" and "hardwired." The parsimony cost of hardwired networks is based on all changes over all edges, hence must be greater than or equal to the best tree cost contained ("displayed") by the network. This is in contrast to softwired, where each character follows the lowest parsimony cost tree displayed by the network, resulting in costs which are less than or equal to the best display tree. Neither situation is ideal since hard-wired networks are not generally biologically attractive (since individual heritable characters can have more than one parent) and softwired networks can be trivially optimized (containing the best tree for each character). Furthermore, given the alternate cost scenarios of trees and these two flavors of networks, hypothesis testing among these explanatory scenarios is impossible. RESULTS: A network cost adjustment (penalty) is proposed to allow phylogenetic trees and soft-wired phylogenetic networks to compete equally on a parsimony optimality basis. This cost is demonstrated for several real and simulated datasets. In each case, the favored graph representation (tree or network) matched expectation or simulation scenario. CONCLUSIONS: The softwired network cost regime proposed here presents a quantitative criterion for an optimality-based search procedure where trees and networks can participate in hypothesis testing simultaneously.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many of the mosquito species responsible for malaria transmission belong to a sibling complex; a taxonomic group of morphologically identical, closely related species. Sibling species often differ in several important factors that have the potential to impact malaria control, including their geographical distribution, resistance to insecticides, biting and resting locations, and host preference. The aim of this study was to define the geographical distributions of dominant malaria vector sibling species in Africa so these distributions can be coupled with data on key factors such as insecticide resistance to aid more focussed, species-selective vector control. RESULTS: Within the Anopheles gambiae species complex and the Anopheles funestus subgroup, predicted geographical distributions for Anopheles coluzzii, An. gambiae (as now defined) and An. funestus (distinct from the subgroup) have been produced for the first time. Improved predicted geographical distributions for Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles melas and Anopheles merus have been generated based on records that were confirmed using molecular identification methods and a model that addresses issues of sampling bias and past changes to the environment. The data available for insecticide resistance has been evaluated and differences between sibling species are apparent although further analysis is required to elucidate trends in resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Sibling species display important variability in their geographical distributions and the most important malaria vector sibling species in Africa have been mapped here for the first time. This will allow geographical occurrence data to be coupled with species-specific data on important factors for vector control including insecticide resistance. Species-specific data on insecticide resistance is available for the most important malaria vectors in Africa, namely An. arabiensis, An. coluzzii, An. gambiae and An. funestus. Future work to combine these data with the geographical distributions mapped here will allow more focussed and resource-efficient vector control and provide information to greatly improve and inform existing malaria transmission models.},

Currently, more than three billion people living in endemic areas are exposed to vector-borne pathogens. Substantial differences in the biology of arthropod vectors make it extremely challenging to predict the incidence of vector-borne diseases in the future. However, global warming and urbanization both profoundly affect the ecology and distribution of arthropod vectors. Such processes often result in a biotic homogenization of species in a non-random process of biodiversity loss. The data presently available indicate a trend towards progressive increases in the presence and abundance of vectors capable of thriving in urban environments amongst humans, thus, increasing the contact between vectors and human hosts. As a consequence, we expect the incidence of vector-borne diseases to increase. In our opinion, resources should be made available and directed to strategies within the Integrated Vector Management framework, focusing on proven vector control tools. Besides, a substantial reduction of IVM costs would be achieved by observing environmental guidelines and providing basic sanitary infrastructure at early stages of its development. This could help to increase IVM effectiveness in attenuating social determinants of health and social inequities due to exposure to vectors.},

Despite this, modelling landscape resistance surfaces has remained a significant challenge. The R package resistancega was developed to provide a framework for optimizing landscape resistance surfaces. In this study, we assessed ResistanceGA's ability to recover the true resistance surface under a variety of scenarios, including when the underlying surface: (a) had different levels of spatial autocorrelation and (b) was transformed into a resistance surface using different functional transformations. These scenarios were evaluated with regard to varying sample size and varying levels of variance in the measure of genetic distance. We also assessed the ability of ResistanceGA to identify the true resistance surface among alternative correlated surfaces. In univariate simulations, correlation between the true and optimized resistance surfaces remained high with increased variance in genetic distance, but only when sample size was moderate to high (≥50). Model selection error was also driven by sample size with low type I error when simulations had moderate to high sample sizes, even with moderate to high variance in genetic distance and correlated alternative surfaces. ResistanceGA also performed well in multivariate simulationsbut had more difficulty identifying the true data generating surfaces when genetic data were simulated using an agent-based approach (especially with individual-based genetic data). Overall, our simulations highlight the ability of ResistanceGA to accurately optimize resistance surfaces but also underscore challenges in optimizing landscape resistance surfaces, especially with highly stochastic individual-based data.},

  abstract = {Malaria is one of the most important human diseases throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Global distribution and ample host range have contributed to the genetic diversity of the etiological agent, Plasmodium. Phylogeographical analyses demonstrated that Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax follow an Out of Africa (OOA) expansion, having a higher genetic diversity in African populations and a low genetic diversity in South American populations. Modeling the evolutionary rate of conserved genes for both P. falciparum and P. vivax determined the approximate arrival of human malaria in South America. Bayesian computational methods suggest that P. falciparum originated in Africa and arrived in South America through multiple independent introductions by the transatlantic African slave trade; however, in South America, P. vivax could have been introduced through an alternate migratory route. Alignments of P. vivax mitogenomes have revealed low genetic variation between the South American and Southeast Asian populations suggesting introduction through either pre-Columbian human migration or post-colonization events. To confirm the findings of these phylogeographical analyses, molecular methods were used to diagnose malaria infection in archeological remains of pre-Columbian ethnic groups. Immunohistochemistry tests were used and identified P. vivax but not P. falciparum in histologically prepared tissues from pre-Columbian Peruvian mummies, whereas shotgun metagenomics sequencing of DNA isolated from pre-Columbian Caribbean coprolites revealed Plasmodium-homologous reads; current evidence suggests that only P. vivax might have been present in pre-Columbian South America.},

  abstract = {Multiple-strain (polygenomic) infections are a ubiquitous feature of Plasmodium falciparum parasite population genetics. Under simple assumptions of superinfection, polygenomic infections are hypothesized to be the result of multiple infectious bites. As a result, polygenomic infections have been used as evidence of repeat exposure and used to derive genetic metrics associated with high transmission intensity. However, not all polygenomic infections are the result of multiple infectious bites. Some result from the transmission of multiple, genetically related strains during a single infectious bite (cotransmission). Superinfection and cotransmission represent two distinct transmission processes, and distinguishing between the two could improve inferences regarding parasite transmission intensity. Here, we describe a new metric, R H, that utilizes the correlation in allelic state (heterozygosity) within polygenomic infections to estimate the likelihood that the observed complexity resulted from either superinfection or cotransmission. R H is flexible and can be applied to any type of genetic data. As a proof of concept, we used R H to quantify polygenomic relatedness and estimate cotransmission and superinfection rates from a set of 1,758 malaria infections genotyped with a 24 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) molecular barcode. Contrary to expectation, we found that cotransmission was responsible for a significant fraction of 43\% to 53\% of the polygenomic infections collected in three distinct epidemiological regions in Senegal. The prediction that polygenomic infections frequently result from cotransmission stresses the need to incorporate estimates of relatedness within polygenomic infections to ensure the accuracy of genomic epidemiology surveillance data for informing public health activities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As public health interventions drive parasite populations to elimination, genetic epidemiology models that incorporate population genomics can be powerful tools for evaluating the effectiveness of continued intervention. However, current genetic epidemiology models may not accurately simulate the population genetic profile of parasite populations, particularly with regard to polygenomic (multi-strain) infections. Current epidemiology models simulate polygenomic infections via superinfection (multiple mosquito bites), despite growing evidence that cotransmission (a single mosquito bite) may contribute to polygenomic infections. METHODS: Here, we quantified the relatedness of strains within 31 polygenomic infections collected from patients in Thiès, Senegal using a hidden Markov model to measure the proportion of the genome that is inferred to be identical by descent. RESULTS: We found that polygenomic infections can be composed of highly related parasites and that superinfection models drastically underestimate the relatedness of strains within polygenomic infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cotransmission is a major contributor to polygenomic infections in Thiès, Senegal. The incorporation of cotransmission into existing genetic epidemiology models may enhance our ability to characterize and predict changes in population structure associated with reduced transmission intensities and the emergence of important phenotypes like drug resistance that threaten to undermine malaria elimination activities.},

  abstract = {Pathogen genomics is a powerful tool for tracking infectious disease transmission. In malaria, identity-by-descent is used to assess the genetic relatedness between parasites and has been used to study transmission and importation. In theory, identity-by-descent can be used to distinguish genealogical relationships to reconstruct transmission history or identify parasites for QTL experiments. MalKinID (Malaria Kinship Identifier) is a new classification model designed to identify genealogical relationships among malaria parasites based on genome-wide identity-by-descent proportions and identity-by-descent segment distributions. MalKinID was calibrated to the genomic data from 3 laboratory-based genetic crosses (yielding 440 parent-child and 9060 full-sibling comparisons). MalKinID identified lab-generated F1 progeny with \&gt;80\% sensitivity and showed that 0.39 (95\% CI 0.28, 0.49) of the second-generation progeny of a NF54 and NHP4026 cross were F1s and 0.56 (0.45, 0.67) were backcrosses of an F1 with the parental NF54 strain. In simulated outcrossed importations, MalKinID reconstructs genealogy history with high precision and sensitivity, with F1-scores exceeding 0.84. However, when importation involves inbreeding, such as during serial co-transmission, the precision and sensitivity of MalKinID declined, with F1-scores (the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity) of 0.76 (0.56, 0.92) and 0.23 (0.0, 0.4) for parent-child and full-sibling and \&lt;0.05 for second-degree and third-degree relatives. Disentangling inbred relationships required adapting MalKinID to perform multisample comparisons. Genealogical inference is most powered when (1) outcrossing is the norm or (2) multisample comparisons based on a predefined pedigree are used. MalKinID lays the foundations for using identity-by-descent to track parasite transmission history and for separating progeny for quantitative-trait-locus experiments.},

  abstract = {Unlike in most pathogens, multiple-strain (polygenomic) infections of P. falciparum are frequently composed of genetic siblings. These genetic siblings are the result of sexual reproduction and can coinfect the same host when cotransmitted by the same mosquito. The degree with which coinfecting strains are related varies among infections and populations. Because sexual recombination occurs within the mosquito, the relatedness of cotransmitted strains could depend on transmission dynamics, but little is actually known of the factors that influence the relatedness of cotransmitted strains. Part of the uncertainty stems from an incomplete understanding of how within-host and within-vector dynamics affect cotransmission. Cotransmission is difficult to examine experimentally but can be explored using a computational model. We developed a malaria transmission model that simulates sexual reproduction in order to understand what determines the relatedness of cotransmitted strains. This study highlights how the relatedness of cotransmitted strains depends on both within-host and within-vector dynamics including the complexity of infection. We also used our transmission model to analyze the genetic relatedness of polygenomic infections following a series of multiple transmission events and examined the effects of superinfection. Understanding the factors that influence the relatedness of cotransmitted strains could lead to a better understanding of the population-genetic correlates of transmission and therefore be important for public health.},

While recent studies have proposed methods to infer who infected whom based on genetic distance between isolates from different individuals, the link between epidemiological relationship and genetic distance is still not well understood. In this study, we investigated the distribution of pairwise genetic distances between samples taken from infected hosts during an outbreak. We proposed an analytically tractable approximation to this distribution, which provides a framework to evaluate the likelihood of particular transmission routes. Our method accounts for the transmission of a genetically diverse inoculum, a possibility overlooked in most analyses. We demonstrated that our approximation can provide a robust estimation of the posterior probability of transmission routes in an outbreak and may be used to rule out transmission events at a particular probability threshold. We applied our method to data collected during an outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ruling out several potential transmission links. Our study sheds light on the accumulation of mutations in a pathogen during an epidemic and provides tools to investigate transmission dynamics, avoiding the intensive computation necessary in many existing methods.},

Identifying who infected whom sheds considerable light on transmission patterns, high-risk settings and subpopulations, and the effectiveness of infection control. Genomic data shed new light on transmission dynamics and can be used to identify clusters of individuals likely to be linked by direct transmission. However, identification of individual routes of infection via single genome samples typically remains uncertain. We investigated the potential of deep sequence data to provide greater resolution on transmission routes, via the identification of shared genomic variants. We assessed several easily implemented methods to identify transmission routes using both shared variants and genetic distance, demonstrating that shared variants can provide considerable additional information in most scenarios. While shared-variant approaches identify relatively few links in the presence of a small transmission bottleneck, these links are highly accurate. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid approach that also incorporates phylogenetic distance to provide greater resolution. We applied our methods to data collected during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, identifying several likely routes of transmission. Our study highlights the power of data from deep sequencing of pathogens as a component of outbreak investigation and epidemiologic analyses.},

While sequence data can provide many important insights into disease spread and pathogen adaptation, it remains unclear how successfully they may be used to estimate individual routes of transmission. Several studies have attempted to reconstruct transmission routes using genomic data; however, these have typically relied upon restrictive assumptions, such as a shared topology of the phylogenetic tree and a lack of within-host diversity. In this study, we investigated the potential for bacterial genomic data to inform transmission network reconstruction. We used simulation models to investigate the origins, persistence and onward transmission of genetic diversity, and examined the impact of such diversity on our estimation of the epidemiological relationship between carriers. We used a flexible distance-based metric to provide a weighted transmission network, and used receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and network entropy to assess the accuracy and uncertainty of the inferred structure. Our results suggest that sequencing a single isolate from each case is inadequate in the presence of within-host diversity, and is likely to result in misleading interpretations of transmission dynamics--under many plausible conditions, this may be little better than selecting transmission links at random. Sampling more frequently improves accuracy, but much uncertainty remains, even if all genotypes are observed. While it is possible to discriminate between clusters of carriers, individual transmission routes cannot be resolved by sequence data alone. Our study demonstrates that bacterial genomic distance data alone provide only limited information on person-to-person transmission dynamics.},

Thus, understanding landscape structure and functioning requires multiscale information, and scaling functions are the most precise and concise way of quantifying multiscale characteristics explicitly. The major objective of this study was to explore if there are any scaling relations for landscape pattern when it is measured over a range of scales (grain size and extent). The results showed that the responses of landscape metrics to changing scale fell into two categories when computed at the class level (i.e., for individual land cover types): simple scaling functions and unpredictable behavior. Similarly, three categories were found at the landscape level, with the third being staircase pattern, in a previous study when all land cover types were combined together. In general, scaling relations were more variable at the class level than at the landscape level, and more consistent and predictable with changing grain size than with changing extent at both levels. Considering that the landscapes under study were quite diverse in terms of both composition and configuration, these results seem robust. This study highlights the need for multiscale analysis in order to adequately characterize and monitor landscape heterogeneity, and provides insights into the scaling of landscape patterns.},

  abstract = {In the Andes, indigenous pastoral communities are confronting new challenges in managing mountain peatland pastures, locally called bofedales. Assessing land cover change using satellite images, vegetation survey, and local knowledge (i.e., traditional ecological knowledge) reveals the multi-faceted socio-ecological dimensions of bofedal change in Sajama National Park (PNS), Bolivia. Here, we present results from focus groups held in 2016 and 2017 to learn about the local knowledge of bofedales in five Aymara communities in PNS. Land cover maps, created from Landsat satellite imagery, provided a baseline reference of the decadal change of bofedales (1986, 1996, 2006, and 2016) and were field verified with vegetation sampling. At the park level, the land cover maps show a reduction of healthy bofedales (i.e., Juncaceae dominated peatland) cover from 33.8 km2 in 1986 to 21.7 km2 in 2016, and an increase in dry mixed grasses (e.g., Poaceae dominated land cover) from 5.1 km2 (1986) to 20.3 km2 (2016). Locals identify climate change, lack of irrigation, difficulty in water access, and loss of communal water management practices as key bofedal management challenges. Local improvement of bofedales was found in one community due to community-based irrigation efforts. Bridging knowledge of mountain land cover change helps to articulate the socio-ecological dimensions that influence local decision-making regarding bofedal management, and consideration of local actions that may be strengthened to support the sustainability of bofedales for local livelihoods in the context of climate change in the Andes.},

Recent conclusions have been drawn using relatively simple biological models1,2 and statistical approaches3,4,5, with inconsistent predictions. Consequently, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) echoes this uncertainty, with no clear guidance for the impacts of climate change on malaria transmission, yet recognizing a strong association between local climate and malaria6,7.

We drive the malaria model using select climate models that correctly reproduce historical West African climate, and project reduced malaria burden in a western sub-region and insignificant impact in an eastern sub-region. Projected impacts of climate change on malaria transmission in this region are not of serious concern.},

  abstract = {Malaria transmission is a complex system and in many parts of the world is closely related to climate conditions. However, studies on environmental determinants of malaria generally consider only concurrent climate conditions and ignore the historical or initial conditions of the system. Here, we demonstrate the concept of hysteresis in malaria transmission, defined as non-uniqueness of the relationship between malaria prevalence and concurrent climate conditions. We show the dependence of simulated malaria transmission on initial prevalence and the initial level of human immunity in the population. Using realistic time series of environmental variables, we quantify the effect of hysteresis in a modeled population. In a set of numerical experiments using HYDREMATS, a field-tested mechanistic model of malaria transmission, the simulated maximum malaria prevalence depends on both the initial prevalence and the initial level of human immunity in the population. We found the effects of initial conditions to be of comparable magnitude to the effects of interannual variability in environmental conditions in determining malaria prevalence. The memory associated with this hysteresis effect is longer in high transmission settings than in low transmission settings. Our results show that efforts to simulate and forecast malaria transmission must consider the exposure history of a location as well as the concurrent environmental drivers.},

  abstract = {Background: Climate change is expected to affect the distribution of environmental suitability for malaria transmission by altering temperature and rainfall patterns; however, the local and global impacts of climate change on malaria transmission are uncertain. Objective: We assessed the effect of climate change on malaria transmission in West Africa. Methods: We coupled a detailed mechanistic hydrology and entomology model with climate projections from general circulation models (GCMs) to predict changes in vectorial capacity, an indication of the risk of human malaria infections, resulting from changes in the availability of mosquito breeding sites and temperature-dependent development rates. Because there is strong disagreement in climate predictions from different GCMs, we focused on the GCM projections that produced the best and worst conditions for malaria transmission in each zone of the study area. Results: Simulation-based estimates suggest that in the desert fringes of the Sahara, vectorial capacity would increase under the worst-case scenario, but not enough to sustain transmission. In the transitional zone of the Sahel, climate change is predicted to decrease vectorial capacity. In the wetter regions to the south, our estimates suggest an increase in vectorial capacity under all scenarios. However, because malaria is already highly endemic among human populations in these regions, we expect that changes in malaria incidence would be small. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of rainfall in shaping the impact of climate change on malaria transmission in future climates. Even under the GCM predictions most conducive to malaria transmission, we do not expect to see a significant increase in malaria prevalence in this region.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the development of a Global 3arc-second Water Body Map (G3WBM), using an automated algorithm to process multi-temporal Landsat images from the Global Land Survey (GLS) database. We used 33,890 scenes from 4 GLS epochs in order to delineate a seamless water body map, without cloud and ice/snow gaps. Permanent water bodies were distinguished from temporal water-covered areas by calculating the frequency of water body existence from overlapping, multi-temporal, Landsat scenes. By analyzing the frequency of water body existence at 3arc-second resolution, the G3WBM separates river channels and floodplains more clearly than previous studies. This suggests that the use of multi-temporal images is as important as analysis at a higher resolution for global water body mapping. The global totals of delineated permanent water body area and temporal water-covered area are 3.25 and 0.49millionkm2 respectively, which highlights the importance of river-floodplain separation using multi-temporal images. The accuracy of the water body classification was validated in Hokkaido (Japan) and in the contiguous United States using an existing water body databases. There was almost no commission error, and about 70\% of lakes {$>$}1km2 shows relative water area error {$<$}25\%. Though smaller water bodies ({$<$}1km2) were underestimated mainly due to omission of shoreline pixels, the overall accuracy of the G3WBM should be adequate for larger scale research in hydrology, biogeochemistry, and climate systems and importantly includes a quantification of the temporal nature of global water bodies.},

The objective of this study was to compare airborne multispectral imagery with airborne hyperspectral imagery for mapping yield variability in grain sorghum fields. Airborne color‐infrared (CIR) imagery and airborne hyperspectral imagery along with yield monitor data collected from four fields were used in this study. Three‐band imagery with wavebands corresponding to the collected CIR imagery and four‐band imagery with wavebands similar to QuickBird satellite imagery were generated from the 102‐band hyperspectral imagery. All four types of imagery (two actual and two simulated) were aggregated to increase pixel size to match the yield data resolution. Principal components and all possible normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) were derived from each type of imagery and related to yield. Statistical analysis showed that the hyperspectral imagery accounted for more variability in yield than the other three types of multispectral imagery and that the best narrow‐band NDVIs among the 5151 NDVIs derived from each hyperspectral image explained more variability than the best NDVIs derived from any of the actual or simulated multispectral images. These results indicate that hyperspectral imagery has the potential for improving yield estimation accuracy. Keywords.

High spatial resolution satellite imagery has the potential for mapping crop growth variability and identifying problem areas within fields. The objectives of this study were to use QuickBird satellite imagery for mapping plant growth and yield patterns within grain sorghum fields as compared with airborne multispectral image data. A QuickBird 2.8-m four-band image covering a cropping area in south Texas, USA was acquired in the 2003 growing season. Airborne three-band imagery with submeter resolution was also collected from two grain sorghum fields within the satellite scene. Yield monitor data collected from the two fields were resampled to match the resolutions of the airborne imagery and the satellite imagery. The airborne imagery was related to yield at original submeter, 2.8 and 8.4\&nbsp;m resolutions and the QuickBird imagery was related to yield at 2.8 and 8.4\&nbsp;m resolutions. The extracted QuickBird images for the two fields were then classified into multiple zones using unsupervised classification and mean yields among the zones were compared. Results showed that grain yield was significantly related to both types of image data and that the QuickBird imagery had similar correlations with grain yield as compared with the airborne imagery at the 2.8 and 8.4\&nbsp;m resolutions. Moreover, the unsupervised classification maps effectively differentiated grain production levels among the zones.

A 2.8-m multispectral QuickBird image covering an intensively cropped area in south Texas was evaluated for crop identification and area estimation. Three reduced-resolution images with pixel sizes of 11.2 m, 19.6 m, and 30.8 m were also generated from the original image to simulate coarser resolution imagery from other satellite systems. Supervised classification techniques were used to classify the original image and the three aggregated images into five crop classes (grain sorghum, cotton, citrus, sugarcane, and melons) and five non-crop cover types (mixed herbaceous species, mixed brush, water bodies, wet areas, and dry soil/roads). The five non-crop classes in the 10-category classification maps were then merged as one class. The classification maps were filtered to remove the small inclusions of other classes within the dominant class. For accuracy assessment of the classification maps, crop fields were ground verified and field boundaries were digitized from the original image to determine reference field areas for the five crops. Overall accuracy for the unfiltered 2.8-m, 11.2-m, 19.6-m, and 30.8-m classification maps were 71.4, 76.9, 77.1, and 78.0\%, respectively, while overall accuracy for the respective filtered classification maps were 83.6, 82.3, 79.8, and 78.5\%. Although increase in pixel size improved overall accuracy for the unfiltered classification maps, the filtered 2.8-m classification map provided the best overall accuracy. Percentage area estimates based on the filtered 2.8-m classification map (34.3, 16.4, 2.3, 2.2, 8.0, and 36.8\% for grain sorghum, cotton, citrus, sugarcane, melons, and non-crop, respectively) agreed well with estimates from the digitized polygon map (35.0, 17.9, 2.4, 2.1, 8.0, and 34.6\% for the respective categories).

Efficient deployment of fire stations is essential to ensure timely response to calls for service. Given the geographic nature of such problems, spatial optimization approaches have long been employed in public facility location modeling along these lines. In particular, median and coverage approaches have been widely adopted to help achieve travel-cost and service-coverage goals, respectively. This paper proposes a bi-objective spatial optimization model that integrates coverage and median goals in the service of demand areas. Based on the properties of derived objective functions, we presented a constraint-based solution procedure to generate the Pareto frontier, enabling the identification of alternative fire station siting scenarios. The developed model is applied to an empirical study that seeks to identify the best fire station locations in Nanjing, China.

  abstract = {Population genetic studies in non-model systems increasingly use next-generation sequencing to obtain more loci, but such methods also generate more missing data that may affect downstream analyses. Here we focus on the principal component analysis (PCA) which has been widely used to explore and visualize population structure with mean-imputed missing data. We simulated data of different population models with various total missingness (1\%, 10\%, 20\%) introduced either randomly or biased among individuals or populations. We found that individuals biased with missing data would be dragged away from their real population clusters to the origin of PCA plots, making them indistinguishable from true admixed individuals and potentially leading to misinterpreted population structure. We also generated empirical data of the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). We filtered three data sets with 19.12\%, 9.87\%, and 1.35\% total missingness, all showing nonrandom missing data with biased individuals dragged towards the PCA origin, consistent with results from simulations. We highlight the importance of considering missing data effects on PCA in non-model systems where nonrandom missing data are common due to varying sample quality. To help detect missing data effects, we suggest to (1) plot PCA with a colour gradient showing per sample missingness, (2) interpret samples close to the PCA origin with extra caution, (3) explore filtering parameters with and without the missingness-biased samples, and (4) use complementary analyses (e.g., model-based methods) to cross-validate PCA results and help interpret population structure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of data in targeting malaria control efforts is essential for optimal use of resources. This work provides a practical mechanism for prioritizing geographic areas for insecticide-treated net (ITN) distribution campaigns in settings with limited resources. METHODS: A GIS-based weighted approach was adopted to categorize and rank administrative units based on data that can be applied in various country contexts where Plasmodium falciparum transmission is reported. Malaria intervention and risk factors were used to rank local government areas (LGAs) in Nigeria for prioritization during mass ITN distribution campaigns. Each factor was assigned a unique weight that was obtained through application of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The weight was then multiplied by a value based on natural groupings inherent in the data, or the presence or absence of a given intervention. Risk scores for each factor were then summated to generate a composite unique risk score for each LGA. This risk score was translated into a prioritization map which ranks each LGA from low to high priority in terms of timing of ITN distributions. RESULTS: A case study using data from Nigeria showed that a major component that influenced the prioritization scheme was ITN access. Sensitivity analysis results indicate that changes to the methodology used to quantify ITN access did not modify outputs substantially. Some 120 LGAs were categorized as 'extremely high' or 'high' priority when a spatially interpolated ITN access layer was used. When prioritization scores were calculated using DHS-reported state level ITN access, 108 (90.0\%) of the 120 LGAs were also categorized as being extremely high or high priority. The geospatial heterogeneity found among input risk factors suggests that a range of variables and covariates should be considered when using data to inform ITN distributions. CONCLUSION: The authors provide a tool for prioritizing regions in terms of timing of ITN distributions. It serves as a base upon which a wider range of vector control interventions could be targeted. Its value added can be found in its potential for application in multiple country contexts, expediated timeframe for producing outputs, and its use of systematically collected malaria indicators in informing prioritization.},

Using ecological niche modeling we identified environmental, behavioral, and population characteristics of H5N1 and H9N2 niches within Egypt. Niches differed markedly by subtype. The subtype niches were combined to model co-infection potential with known occurrences used for validation. The distance to live bird markets was a strong predictor of co-infection.

  abstract = {The correlation between alleles at a pair of genetic loci is a measure of linkage disequilibrium. The square of the sample correlation multiplied by sample size provides the usual test statistic for the hypothesis of no disequilibrium for loci with two alleles and this relation has proved useful for study design and marker selection. Nevertheless, this relation holds only in a diallelic case, and an extension to multiple alleles has not been made. Here we introduce a similar statistic, R2, which leads to a correlation-based test for loci with multiple alleles: for a pair of loci with k and m alleles, and a sample of n individuals, the approximate distribution of n(k - 1)(m - 1)/(km)R2 under independence between loci is chi2(k-1(m-1). One advantage of this statistic is that it can be interpreted as the total correlation between a pair of loci. When the phase of two-locus genotypes is known, the approach is equivalent to a test for the overall correlation between rows and columns in a contingency table. In the phase-known case, R2 is the sum of the squared sample correlations for all km 2 x 2 subtables formed by collapsing to one allele vs. the rest at each locus. We examine the approximate distribution under the null of independence for R2 and report its close agreement with the exact distribution obtained by permutation. The test for independence using R2 is a strong competitor to approaches such as Pearson's chi square, Fisher's exact test, and a test based on Cressie and Read's power divergence statistic. We combine this approach with our previous composite-disequilibrium measures to address the case when the genotypic phase is unknown. Calculation of the new multiallele test statistic and its P-value is very simple and utilizes the approximate distribution of R2. We provide a computer program that evaluates approximate as well as "exact" permutational P-values.},

However, the methods for quantifying resistance surfaces are varied and there is no general consensus on the appropriate choice of environmental data or analytical approaches. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature on this topic to highlight methods used and identify knowledge gaps. Our review includes 96 papers that parameterized resistance surfaces (sometimes using multiple approaches) for a variety of taxa. Data types used included expert opinion (n~=~76), detection (n~=~23), relocation (n~=~8), pathway (n~=~2), and genetic (n~=~28). We organized the papers into three main analytical approaches; one-stage expert opinion, one-stage empirical, and two-stage empirical, each of which was represented by 43, 22, and 36 papers, respectively. We further organized the empirical approaches into five main resource selection functions; point (n~=~16), matrix (n~=~38), home range (n~=~3), step (n~=~1), and pathway (n~=~1). We found a general lack of justification for choice of environmental variables and their thematic and spatial representation, a heavy reliance on expert opinion and detection data, and a tendency to confound movement behavior and resource use. Future research needs include comparative analyses on the choice of environmental variables and their spatial and thematic scales, and on the various biological data types used to estimate resistance. Comparative analyses amongst analytical processes is also needed, as well as transparency in reporting on uncertainty in parameter estimates and sensitivity of final resistance surfaces, especially if the resistance surfaces are to be used for conservation and planning purposes.},

  abstract = {Force of infection (FOI), defined as the number of new Plasmodium falciparum infections acquired by an individual host over a given time interval, is a direct measure of exposure to Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage infection. It reflects risk of infection and clinical episodes, and relates local variation in malaria burden to transmission. It is thus suitable for monitoring the impact of antimalarial interventions and assessing vaccine or drug efficacy in clinical trials. Despite being recognized as a key epidemiological parameter, FOI remains difficult, expensive, and labor-intensive to accurately measure, either directly via cohort studies or indirectly via the fitting of epidemiological models to repeated cross-sectional surveys. Molecular advances to sequence and type the var multigene family encoding for the major surface antigen of the blood stage of infection, provide a basis to estimate a sister “static” quantity, the multiplicity of infection (MOI, the number of genetically distinct parasite strains co-infecting a single human host), typically under sparse sampling schemes. Having extended this approach to a Bayesian framework to account for measurement error, we propose a general approach to obtain FOI on the basis of MOI. We specifically adapt two methods from queuing theory to derive FOI, and evaluate these with numerical simulations with a stochastic agent-based model. We then apply the methods to longitudinal surveys from northern Ghana before, during, and after a three-round IRS (Insecticide Residual Spreading) intervention. Both methods give accurate and consistent FOI estimates across various simulated scenarios. Their application to field surveys shows that despite a pronounced 60\% reduction in FOI during IRS, transmission intensity rebounds almost completely in 32 months following IRS interruption. The methods should be applicable to many geographical locations where cohort or frequently-sampled cross-sectional studies are lacking but single-time-point surveys under sparse sampling schemes are available. They should also apply to other infectious diseases for which MOI has been obtained.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parasite genetic diversity and multiplicity of infection (MOI) affect clinical outcomes, response to drug treatment and naturally-acquired or vaccine-induced immunity. Traditional methods often underestimate the frequency and diversity of multiclonal infections due to technical sensitivity and specificity. Next-generation sequencing techniques provide a novel opportunity to study complexity of parasite populations and molecular epidemiology. METHODS: Symptomatic and asymptomatic Plasmodium vivax samples were collected from health centres/hospitals and schools, respectively, from 2011 to 2015 in Ethiopia. Similarly, both symptomatic and asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum samples were collected, respectively, from hospitals and schools in 2005 and 2015 in Kenya. Finger-pricked blood samples were collected and dried on filter paper. Long amplicon ({$>$}\,400~bp) deep sequencing of merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1) gene was conducted to determine multiplicity and molecular epidemiology of P. vivax and P. falciparum infections. The results were compared with those based on short amplicon (117~bp) deep sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 139 P. vivax and 222 P. falciparum samples were pyro-sequenced for pvmsp1 and pfmsp1, yielding a total of 21 P. vivax and 99 P. falciparum predominant haplotypes. The average MOI for P. vivax and P. falciparum were 2.16 and 2.68, respectively, which were significantly higher than that of microsatellite markers and short amplicon (117~bp) deep sequencing. Multiclonal infections were detected in 62.2\% of the samples for P. vivax and 74.8\% of the samples for P. falciparum. Four out of the five subjects with recurrent P. vivax malaria were found to be a relapse 44-65~days after clearance of parasites. No difference was observed in MOI among P. vivax patients of different symptoms, ages and genders. Similar patterns were also observed in P. falciparum except for one study site in Kenyan lowland areas with significantly higher MOI. CONCLUSIONS: The study used a novel method to evaluate Plasmodium MOI and molecular epidemiological patterns by long amplicon ultra-deep sequencing. The complexity of infections were similar among age groups, symptoms, genders, transmission settings (spatial heterogeneity), as well as over years (pre- vs. post-scale-up interventions). This study demonstrated that long amplicon deep sequencing is a useful tool to investigate multiplicity and molecular epidemiology of Plasmodium parasite infections.},

In order to assess if malaria transmission reservoir is associated with this stagnation, submicroscopic infection and gametocyte carriage was estimated. Risk factors and associations between malaria control interventions and gametocyte carriage were further investigated in this study. METHODS: A total of 996 dried blood spot samples were used from two strata, all smear-positives (516 samples) and randomly selected smear-negatives (480 samples), from a community cross-sectional survey conducted at peak transmission season in 2012 in Siaya County, western Kenya. Plasmodium falciparum parasite presence and density were determined by stained blood smear and by 18S mRNA transcripts using nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assay (NASBA), gametocyte presence and density were determined by blood smear and by Pfs25 mRNA-NASBA, and gametocyte diversity by Pfg377 mRNA RT-PCR and RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Of the randomly selected smear-negative samples, 69.6~\% (334/480) were positive by 18S-NASBA while 18S-NASBA detected 99.6~\% (514/516) smear positive samples. Overall, 80.2~\% of the weighted population was parasite positive by 18S-NASBA vs 30.6~\% by smear diagnosis and 44.0~\% of the weighted population was gametocyte positive by Pfs25-NASBA vs 2.6~\% by smear diagnosis. Children 5-15~years old were more likely to be parasitaemic and gametocytaemic by NASBA than individuals {$>$}15~years old or children~{$<$}5~years old while gametocyte density decreased with age. Anaemia and self-reported fever within the past 24~h were associated with increased odds of gametocytaemia. Fever was also positively associated with parasite density, but not with gametocyte density. Anti-malarial use within the past 2~weeks decreased the odds of gametocytaemia, but not the odds of parasitaemia. In contrast, recent anti-malarial use was associated with lowered parasite density, but not the gametocyte density. Use of ITNs was associated with lower odds for parasitaemia in part of the study area with a longer history of ITN interventions. In the same part of study area, the odds of having multiple gametocyte alleles were also lower in individuals using ITNs than in those not using ITNs and parasite density was positively associated with gametocyte diversity. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of submicroscopic parasites and gametocytes in western Kenya might contribute to the stagnation in malaria prevalence, suggesting that additional interventions targeting the infectious reservoir are needed. As school aged children and persons with anaemia and fever were major sources for gametocyte reservoir, these groups should be targeted for intervention and prevention to reduce malaria transmission. Anti-malarial use was associated with lower parasite density and odds of gametocytaemia, but not the gametocyte density, indicating a limitation of anti-malarial impact on the transmission reservoir. ITN use had a protective role against parasitaemia and gametocyte diversity in western Kenya.},

  abstract = {Surveillance and response represent the final crucial steps in achieving effective control and particularly elimination of communicable diseases as recognized in the area of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), applied in increasing numbers in endemic countries with ongoing control and elimination programmers. More and more national NTD elimination initiatives are scheduled based on the innovative and effective One world-One health perspective to detect pockets of transmission and disease reintroduction. Resource-constrained countries, which carry the heaviest NTD burdens, face various challenges how to strengthen the health system as well as developing effective and novel tools for surveillance and response tailored to local settings. Surveillance-response approaches take place in two different stages corralling the basic components of the surveillance-response system for NTD elimination. Six different research priorities have been identified:1)dynamic mapping of transmission, 2) near real-time capture of population dynamics, 3) modelling based on a minimum essential database/dataset, 4) implementation of mobile health (m-health) and sensitive diagnostics, 5) design of effective response packages tailored to different transmission settings and levels, and 6) validation of approaches and responses packages.},

  abstract = {Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are among the three major intervention measures that have reduced malaria transmission in the past decade. However, increased insecticide resistance in vectors, together with outdoor transmission, has limited the efficacy of the ITN scaling-up efforts. Observations on longitudinal changes in ITN coverage and its impact on malaria transmission allow policy makers to make informed adjustments to control strategies. We analyzed field surveys on ITN ownership, malaria parasite prevalence, and malaria vector population dynamics in seven sentinel sites in western Kenya from 2003 to 2015. We found that ITN ownership has increased from an average of 18\% in 2003 to 85\% in 2015. Malaria parasite prevalence in school children decreased by about 70\% from 2003 to 2008 (the first mass distribution of free ITNs was in 2006) but has resurged by {$>$}50\% since then. At the community level, use of ITNs reduced infections by 23\% in 2008 and 43\% in 2010, although the reduction was down to 25\% in 2011. The indoor-resting density of the predominant vector, Anopheles gambiae, has been suppressed since 2007; however, Anopheles funestus populations have resurged and have increased 20-fold in some places since 2007. In conclusion, there is limited room for further increase in ITN coverage in western Kenya. The rebounding in malaria transmission highlights the urgent need of new or improved malaria control interventions so as to further reduce malaria transmission.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The presence of multiple infecting strains of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum affects key phenotypic traits, including drug resistance and risk of severe disease. Advances in protocols and sequencing technology have made it possible to obtain high-coverage genome-wide sequencing data from blood samples and blood spots taken in the field. However, analyzing and interpreting such data is challenging because of the high rate of multiple infections present. Results: We have developed a statistical method and implementation for deconvolving multiple genome sequences present in an individual with mixed infections. The software package DEploid uses haplotype structure within a reference panel of clonal isolates as a prior for haplotypes present in a given sample. It estimates the number of strains, their relative proportions and the haplotypes presented in a sample, allowing researchers to study multiple infection in malaria with an unprecedented level of detail.

  abstract = {Studies of land surface dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes often require remote sensing data with high acquisition frequency and high spatial resolution. However, no single sensor meets this requirement. This study presents a new spatiotemporal data fusion method, the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method, to generate synthesized frequent high spatial resolution images through blending two types of data, i.e., frequent coarse spatial resolution data, such as that from MODIS, and less frequent high spatial resolution data such as that from Landsat. The proposed method is based on spectral unmixing analysis and a thin plate spline interpolator. Compared with existing spatiotemporal data fusion methods, it has the following strengths: (1) it needs minimum input data; (2) it is suitable for heterogeneous landscapes; and (3) it can predict both gradual change and land cover type change. Simulated data and real satellite images were used to test the performance of the proposed method. Its performance was compared with two very popular methods, the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and an unmixing-based data fusion (UBDF) method. Results show that the new method creates more accurate fused images and keeps more spatial detail than STARFM and UBDF. More importantly, it closely captures reflectance changes caused by land cover conversions, which is a big issue with current spatiotemporal data fusion methods. Because the proposed method uses simple principles and needs only one fine-resolution image as input, it has the potential to increase the availability of high-resolution time-series data that can support studies of rapid land surface dynamics.},

  abstract = {Individual malaria infections can carry multiple strains of Plasmodium falciparum with varying levels of relatedness. Yet, how local epidemiology affects the properties of such mixed infections remains unclear. Here, we develop an enhanced method for strain deconvolution from genome sequencing data, which estimates the number of strains, their proportions, identity-by-descent (IBD) profiles and individual haplotypes. Applying it to the Pf3k data set, we find that the rate of mixed infection varies from 29\% to 63\% across countries and that 51\% of mixed infections involve more than two strains. Furthermore, we estimate that 47\% of symptomatic dual infections contain sibling strains likely to have been co-transmitted from a single mosquito, and find evidence of mixed infections propagated over successive infection cycles. Finally, leveraging data from the Malaria Atlas Project, we find that prevalence correlates within Africa, but not Asia, with both the rate of mixed infection and the level of IBD.},
